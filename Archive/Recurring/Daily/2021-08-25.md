	- [x] **1. Read _Speech Craft, Chapter 1_ and complete the [Ch 1 Reading Quiz](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/84042/modules/495984 "[WEEK 1] Informative Unit: course introductions & building confidence, Aug 23-27") by the start of class on Wed, Aug 25.  
 		 **_As our [course syllabus](https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/84042/pages/spcm-212-syllabus "SpCm 212 Syllabus") describes, after reading each chapter of the e-textbook this semester, you will complete a brief reading quiz to check your understanding of key course concepts and prepare for class. These reading quizzes are adaptive and game-like, which means that they are set up to help you focus on the material with which you need the most help. If you miss a question, you will receive feedback and a link to the portion of the textbook to review--and then you get to try again.  Quizzes are graded based on completion._

### Remove Ambiguity 

- Add Delimiters 

### Give Operator Precedence 

- If more than one operator is present in the expression, the precedence order decides the order in which the operators should be applied 
- Modify grammar: add non-terminals for each precedence level, push the higher levels towards the bottom of the parse tree 

### Define Associativity 

- if the same operator appears more than once in the same expression then  associativity rule decides the order in which the operators should be applied 
- Left vs right associativity
	- Left: operators on the left are applied before the right 
	- Right:  operators on the left are applied before the left

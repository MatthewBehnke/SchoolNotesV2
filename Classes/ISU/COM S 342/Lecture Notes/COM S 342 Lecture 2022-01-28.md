### Designing Grammars: Recursion and disjoint composition 

1. Use recursive productions to generate an arbitrary number of symbols 
2. Use separate non-terminals to generate disjoint parts of a language, and combing in a production
3. To generate languages with matching, balanced, or related numbers of symbols, write productions which generate strings from the middle

### Prefix, Infix, Postfix 

- Prefix: Operators are written before their operand. Operators act on the new nearest values on the right 
- infix Operators are written in-between their operands 
- Postfix: Operators are written after their operands

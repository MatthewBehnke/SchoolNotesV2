# GEOL 100 Study Questions 34-3

## What is the water table 

marks the top of the overall groundwater reservoir and separates a seep saturated zone from the upper unsaturated zone of the ground water

## What is the difference between the unsaturated and saturated zone in the groundwater system 

has water vs does not have water 

## How is water flow different within the unsaturated and saturated zones 
water flows both vertically and horizontally in the saturated zone 


## What are two important factors that affect the elevation of the water table 

local topography , natural rainfall 

## Are lakes and rivers part of the groundwater system 

Yes because a river and lakes are exposed parts of the water table 

## What is the relationship between pressure in the ground water system and the direction of groundwater flow 

They will flow from areas of recharge to areas of discharge 


## Can groundwater move upwards against gravity 

yes if it is in the saturated zone or there i pressure

# GEOL 100 Study Questions 26-1

## Which seismic wave travels at the highest speed? Lowest speed? 

P waves are the fastest then S waves then surface waves 

## How is triangulation used to locate earthquakes epicenters 

using at least three seismic stations to triangulate the location of the earthquake we need four to find the depth 

## What physical properties of earth materials cause seismic waves to either speed up or slow down

High density means faster wave and low density = slow wave.  Also solids = faster wave and liquids mean slow or stopping of a wave

## What are s-wave shadows and how were they used to determine the location of the liquid outer core

The shadow is where the seismic waves do not reach because of the liquid core. s waves can not go through the liquids.

## What are p-wave shadows and how were they used to determine the location of the solid inner core

The shadow of the waves minus the waves that went into the inner core because the waves that go into the core get magnified.

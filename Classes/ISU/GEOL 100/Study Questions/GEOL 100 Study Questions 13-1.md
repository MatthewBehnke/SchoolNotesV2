# GEOL 100 Study Questions 13-1

## What is [[physical weathering]]

The disintegration and decomposition of rock through physical processes. Rocks are broken into smaller pieces without a change in chemical composition.

## What does physical weathering produce

The rocks broken up by physical weathering produce produce lose fragments of rocks turn into sediment.

## What is [[chemical weathering]]

Chemical weathering is a chemical transformation of rock into new compounds.  

## what does chemical weathering produce 

The dissolved ions produce new more stable minerals. 

## How does a change in rock's environment make it susceptible to weathering 

Deep underground rocks can experience physical weathering because of [[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/Plate Tectonics]] but they can also experience physical weathering from being on the surface from nature. Where chemical weathering happens around water and nature.

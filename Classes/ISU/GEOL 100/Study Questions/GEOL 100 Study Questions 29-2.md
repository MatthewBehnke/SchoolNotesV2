# GEOL 100 Study Questions 29-2


## What is the Coriolis effect

In the northern hemisphere objects appear to be deflected to the right where in the southern hemisphere objects appear to be deflected to the left

## In what direction are objects or fluids deflected due to the Coriolis effect in the northern/southern hemisphere 

right in the northern and left in the southern

## What is downwelling in the context of ocean currents 

sinking of surface water 


## What causes the Gulf Stream to downwell in the North Atlantic Ocean

it goes through a high evaporation zone that causes the serenity to increase plus the cold water causes the water to sink to the deeper water


## What is upwelling in the context of ocean currents

when the water returns to the surface and brings lots of nutrients 

## What is the Ekman transport

causes the net flow of water disturbed by a surface wind to be oriented 90 degrees to the right of the wind direction. 


## How does Ekman transport lead to upwelling of deep ocean water near continents 

when the water gets pushed out to the greater ocean new water has to be brought back up to replace it.

# GEOL 100 Study Questions 25-3

## What are seismic waves 

Seismic waves is the release of energy stored in elastic deformation of a fault. 

body ( P and S waves )
surface (L and R waves )

## How do materials respond when p-waves and s-waves travel through them

p waves: The material first experiences compression then expansion that is parallel to the waves. 

s waves: The movement is perpendicular to the energy. These are also called shear waves because the material is shifted up and then down. 


## Why can't s-waves travel through liquids 

liquids have no shear strength because they can not respond back to any force because it just moves out of the way. 

## Which type of seismic wave causes the most damage at the surface of the earth

The slowest moving wave causes the most damage. 

## Which seismic waves can travel through both solids and liquids 

p waves 

## What happens to the path of a seismic wave when it passes into a material that causes the wave to slow down 

The seismic wave was refracted 


## A material that causes the wave to speed up

The seismic wave was reflected 

## How does the refraction and reflection of a seismic waves allow us to detect earthquakes that are far away

Because the inner part of the earth is more dense than the surface the seismic wave speeds up and will refract but it will also reflect up to the surface allowing the seismic activity to be noticed a long ways away.

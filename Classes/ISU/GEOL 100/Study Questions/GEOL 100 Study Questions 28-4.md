# GEOL 100 Study Questions 28-4

## What are submarine canyons and how do they information

disturbance of unstable sediment of the continental slope will cause mixture of sediment and water to flow down and erode the slope 

## What is a turbidity current 

a mixture of sediment and water that has a higher density than the surrounding water can become channelized and erode the seafloor

## What is a turbidity deposit 

sedimentary structures are features preserved in and by sediment at the time of depositional condition, such as water velocity 


## why do turbidity deposits consist of larger gains of sediment at the bottom and smaller grains near the top

because large grains dispurse out of water sooner than lighter ones

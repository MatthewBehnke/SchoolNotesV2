# GEOL 100 Study Questions 13-3

## What is a common example of dissolution  in the context of chemical weathering

Water when electrically charged can disrupt ionic bounds in minerals. 

## How is the crystalline structure of a mineral disrupted during hydrolysis

The ions in minerals are replaced with water in a reaction resulting in the crystalline structure being disrupted. 

## What kind of minerals typically form as a result of hydrolysis

Clay and similar minerals

## What kind of minerals are commonly susceptible to oxidation

minerals that are iron bearing 

## How can we use bowen's reaction series to predict which minerals will readily break down due to chemical weathering


The minerals that are the least stable will be the ones that are the fastest weathering 


## How does physical weathering facilitate chemical weathering

physical weathering can allow water and other fluids or air into more of the mineral resulting in a larger surface area for chemical weathering to happen.

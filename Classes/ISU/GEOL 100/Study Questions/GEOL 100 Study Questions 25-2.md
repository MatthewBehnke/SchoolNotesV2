# GEOL 100 Study Questions 25-2

## What is stick-slip behavior at a fault 

A stick slip is when stress and strain accumulates at a fault but friction keeps the fault blocks locked until the stress exceeds the friction and a sudden and rapid offset 

## What causes the two sides of the fault to stick together in the first place
Lots a friction because the friction is higher than the stress

## What is slip propagation in the context of earthquakes and faults

Localized fault slippage that only relieves stress locally. Also adjacent ares of the fault may experience sudden increases in stress and elastic deformation.

## what is fault creep 

fault creep is when a fault is allowed to move with out the build up of stress

## What is slow slip behavior at a fault

Slow slip behavior is when the stress in a fault is released slowly over time.

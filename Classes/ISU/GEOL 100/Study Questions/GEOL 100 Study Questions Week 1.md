# GEOL 100 Study Questions Week 1

1.  What are the layers of Earth’s interior based on chemical composition? How are they different in chemical composition?  
	 -  The layers of the earth based on chemical composition include for the crust layer Oceanic and Continental. Then there is the mantle then the core. Each layer has a different chemical composition.
   
1.  What are the layers of the Earth’s interior based on physical properties? How are they different in terms of physical properties?   
      
	  - The layers of the earth based on physical properties include the Lithosphere which is made up of strong rock. Then there is the Asthenosphere that is made up of soft rock. Next there is the outer core that is comprised of liquid iron nickel. Last is the inner core that is made up of solid iron-nickel.
    
1.   Which is more rigid, the [[Lithosphere]] or the [[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/Asthenosphere]]?     
		- The lithosphere is more rigid. 


1.  Which layer can flow, the [[Lithosphere]] or the [[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/Asthenosphere]]?  
	- The asthenosphere can flow 
1.   How is the inner core different from the outer core?  
		- The inner core is different from the outer core in one primary way. First it is solid compared to liquid like the outer core. Next the inner core is thicker and is in the middle of the earth.

1.   What chemical layers make up the physical layers?     
		- The lithosphere comprises the crust and the top layer of the mantle. 
		- The asthenosphere is comprised of the mantle
		- The outer and inner core are comprised of the core

1.   What allows the [[Lithosphere]] to move independently of the [[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/Asthenosphere]]?  

		- The lithosphere can move independently of the asthenosphere because of the diffrent physial layers. The Lithosphere is made up of a stronger material that wants to stay togeter. Where the asthenosphere is made up of highly compressed material that is a solid but has give that will move out of the way. So the asthenosphere gives way for the lithosphere to move.

1.   What are the 4 lines of evidence Alfred Wegener used to develop his Continental Drift hypothesis?  
		-  The matching shapes of the contents
			South America and Africa
		- Transcontinental distribution of terrestrial plant and animal fossils 
		-  Evidence of ancient climates in the wrong places  ( evidence of glacial and swamp environments)
		-  Mountain ranges of similar age and composition on the opposite sides of the ocean 
    
1.   What are the flaws in the Continental Drift hypothesis?  
		  - Wegener’s characterization of the continental drift process was greatly flawed 
		  -  Movement of continent due to tidal forces applied by the Moon and Sun
		 - Continents moved through oceanic crust, not with oceanic crust 
		 - General concept of drifting continents rejected by influential geologists who did not work on southern continents

    
1.   According to Wegener’s hypothesis, what force caused the continents to move relative to each other?  
      
		- He thought that the gravitational forces from the Moon and Sun
    
1.   What is “[[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/The Expanding Earth Hypothesis]]”?  
      
	    - The expanding earth hypothesis states that the earth is expanding and that's why wagener's evidence holds true
    
1.   How is a magnetic field generated in a solenoid magnet?  
		  - 
    
1.  How is the outer core similar to a solenoid magnet?  
      
    
1.  What allows charged particles (electrons) to move in the outer core?  
      
    
1.   What is the definition of magnetic inclination? How can magnetic inclination be used as a rough measurement of latitude?  
      
    
1.   What is the definition of magnetic declination?  
      
    
1.   What is paleomagnetism?  
      
    
1.   How do rocks preserve paleomagnetic signals?  
      
    
1.   What is an “apparent polar wander path”?  
      
    
1.   If continents do not move over geologic time, would their apparent polar wander paths be the same or different?  
      
    
1.   If continents do move relative to each other, would their apparent polar wander paths be the same or different?  
      
    
1.   How do plates move relative to each other at a divergent plate boundary?  
      
    
1.   How is new plate material (i.e., lithosphere) created at a divergent boundary?  
      
    
1.   What is a magnetic anomaly? What does a positive anomaly mean?  What does a negative anomaly mean?  
      
    
1.   Why is the pattern of magnetic anomalies on one side of a divergent boundary a mirror image of the anomalies on the opposite side?  
      
    
1.   How does the age of the oceanic lithosphere change as you move away from an oceanic ridge (i.e., divergent boundary)? Why?  
      
    
1.   How do plates move relative to each other at a convergent plate boundary?  
      
    
1.   How is lithosphere “destroyed” or “recycled” at a convergent boundary?  
      
    
1.   What are the 3 different types of convergent plate boundaries?  
      
    
1.   Why do some plates subduct or not subduct under others at convergent boundaries?  
      
    
1.   What is a subduction zone? What is a trench?   
      
    
1.   What is a continental volcanic arc? What is an island volcanic arc?  
      
    
1.   How do plates move relative to each other at a transform plate boundary?  
      
    
1.   Why is lithosphere neither created nor destroyed at a transform boundary?  
      
    
1.   Why do earthquakes occur at all three types of plate boundaries?  
      
    
1.   Which plate boundaries have shallow earthquakes?  
      
    
1.   Which plate boundaries have deep earthquakes?  
      
    
1.   Why do volcanoes form at divergent and convergent boundaries and not at transform boundaries?  
      
    
1.   What is a magma hot spot? How do hot spot tracks form?   
      
    
1.   At a hot spot, which is moving: the magma plume or the plate on top of the plume?   
      
    
1.   How can we use hot spot tracks to determine which way plates move over time?

# GEOL 100 Study Questions 32-2

## How was the longitudinal gradient of Shell Creek used to identify the zone of sediment production  and the zone of transportation 

The zone of sediment production has a steep angle where the zone of transportation has a small slope. 

## Is discharge higher in Shell Creek's zone of transportation than its zone of sediment production 

The discharge is higher in the zone of transportation compared to the zone of production

## Is channel roughness lower in Shell Creek's zone of transportation than its zone of sediment production

The channel is the most rough in the zone of production compared to the zone of transportation 

## How does stream sinuosity change along Shell Creek 

The stream is the most sinuous in the zone of transpiration 


## Why does Snake River does not match expectations from out water shed model. 

because the elevation change is very low at the beginning of the zone of production then increases at the zone of transportation

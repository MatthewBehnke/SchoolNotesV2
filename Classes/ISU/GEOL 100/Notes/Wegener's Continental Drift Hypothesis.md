# Wegener’s Continental Drift Hypothesis


## Wegener proposed the hypothesis
1. At one time in the geologic past, all continents were joined together ([[Classes/ISU/GEOL 100/Notes/Pangaea]])
2. They subsequently drifted apart to the present positions

## Wegener's evidence 
1. The matching shapes of the contents
	South America and Africa
2. Transcontinental distribution of terrestrial plant and animal fossils 
3. Evidence of ancient climates in the wrong places  ( evidence of glacial and swamp environments)
4. Mountain ranges of similar age and composition on the opposite sides of the ocean 

## Problems with Continental Drift Hypothesis
1. Wegener’s characterization of the continental drift process was greatly flawed 
2. Movement of continent due to tidal forces applied by the Moon and Sun
3. Continents moved through oceanic crust, not with oceanic crust 
4. General concept of drifting continents rejected by influential geologists who did not work on southern continents

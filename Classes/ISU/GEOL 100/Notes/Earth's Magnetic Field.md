# Earth's Magnetic Field 

- Moving electric charges generate a magnetic field
- The liquid iron-nickel outer core flows in convection patters from the hotter inner core to the cooler lower mantle 
- Earth's rotation causes convection cells to spiral in alignment with Earth's rotation axis

Out planet is a dipolar magnetic field that is roughly aligned with the axis

# Magnetic Inclination

- Magnetic inclination: the angle between orientation of a magnetic field line and the surface of the earth
- 0 degrees near the Equator 
- 90 degrees at the magnetic poles
- Rough measurement of geographic latitude

Magnetic declination = the difference in positions between the magnetic poles and the rotational axis -> longitude

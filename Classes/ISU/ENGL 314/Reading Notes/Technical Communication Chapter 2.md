copyright law is a legal one 

#### GUIDELINES: Determining Fair Use 

- The purpose and character of the use (for profit)
- The nature and purpose of the copyrighted work 
- The amount and substantiality of the portion of the work used 
- The effect of the use on the potential marker for the copyrighted work 

#### GUIDELINES: Dealing with Copyright Questions 

- abide by the fair use concept 
- seek permission
- cite your sources accurately
- consult legal counsel if you have questions 

#### ETHICS NOTE: Distinguishing Plagiarism from Acceptable Reuse of Information 



### TRADEMARK LAW 
- A trademark is a word, phrase, name, or symbol that is
identified with a company. The company uses the TM symbol
after the product name to claim the design or device as a
trademark. However, using this symbol does not grant the
company any legal rights. It simply sends a message to other
organizations that the company is claiming a trademark. 

- A registered trademark is a word, phrase, name, or symbol that
the company has registered with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. The company can then use the ® symbol
after the trademarked item. Registering a trademark, a process
that can take years, ensures much more legal protection than
a simple trademark throughout the United States, as well as in
other nations. Although a company is not required to use the
symbol, doing so makes it easier for the company to take legal
action against another organization that it believes has
infringed on its trademark. 


#### GUIDELINES: Protecting Trademarks 

- Distinguish trademarks from other material
- Use the trademark symbol 
- use the trademarked item's bane as an adjective, not as a noun or verb
- Do not use the possessive form of the trademarked name 

### CONTRACT LAW 

- The merchant ability warranty 
- fitness warranty 

### LIABILITY LAW


#### GUIDELINES: Abiding by Liability Laws 

- understand the product and its likely users
- Describe the product's functions and limitations 
- instruct users on all aspects of ownership 
- Use appropriate works and graphics
- warn users about the risks of using or misusing the product 
- include warning along with assertions of safety 
- Make directions and warnings conspicuous 
- make sure the the instructions comply with applicable company standards and local state, and federal laws 
- preform usability testing 
- make sure users receive the information

# Probability Intro

## Goals 
- Probability: model and assign probabilities to outcomes 
- Statistics: use probability models to draw conclusions / learn

## Definitions 
- Probability is a mathematical theory for modeling processes where outcomes occur randomly
- Statistics is learning about the real world from data under the assumption that the data was generated by a random process
- Random experiment is an experiment (or process) for which outcomes could be anticipated but not be predicted with certainty 
- Outcome: the outcome ($\omega$) is the result of an experiment 
- Sample Space: The sample space ($\Omega$) is the set of ALL possible outcomes 
	- finite -> discrete
	- Countable infinite -> discrete 
	- uncountable infinite -> not discrete 
- Events: An Event (A, B, C, etc) is a collections of outcomes from the sample space that we are interested in ($A \subseteq \Omega$) 
	- We are eventually interested in the probability of events


## Example 6

$\mathbb{P} (C) = 0.9 \Rightarrow$ The probability of event $C$ is $0.9$

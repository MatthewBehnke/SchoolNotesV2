# Permutations 

## Ordered Without Replacement

The order matters 
 
$Sample$ $Space$ $\Omega$  = $\{(x_{1},...x_{k}): x_{i}\in \{1,...,n\}, x_{i}\not= x_j\}$ if $i \not=j$

What is $|\Omega|$?

Break complex actions into a series of k single draws 

1. n possibilities for $x_1$
2. n -1 possibilities for $x_2$
3. n -2 possibilities for $x_2$

k. n - (k - 1) possibilities for $x_k$

Multiplication principle ....
This is equivalent to $\frac{n!}{(n -k)!}$


## Permutation 

### Definition 
A permutation is an ordering of K distinct objects chosen form n objects. This is another name for the ordered without replacement scenario

# Introduction to Combinatorics 

## Equally likely outcomes

### Theorem 
If events in sample space are equally likely (i.e $\mathbb{p}(\{w\}))$ is the same for all $w \in \Omega$, then the probability of an event A is given by 
$\mathbb{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$

where $|A|$ is the number of elements in set A (carnality of A)

## Multiplication Principle 


### Multiplication Principle 
If a complex action can be broken down into a series of K component actions, preformed one after the other, where...
- First action can be preformed in $n_1$ ways
- last action can be preformed in $n_k$ ways 

Then the complex action can be preformed in $n_{1},n_{2}, n_k$ ways 


### Example 3:

4  shirts times 2 pants = 8 combos 

### Example 4:

(3^26 * 3 ) * (3^10 * 3) ways 

## Sample selection 

Imagine picking k objects from a box containing n objects 

### Definitions 

$with$ $replacement$: After each selection, the object is put back in the box. Each object can be selected multiple times

$without$ $replacement$: After each selection, the object is removed and can not be selected again 

$ordered$ $sample$: Order of selected objects matters (passwords)

$unordered$ $sample$ Order selected objects do not matter (project groups)

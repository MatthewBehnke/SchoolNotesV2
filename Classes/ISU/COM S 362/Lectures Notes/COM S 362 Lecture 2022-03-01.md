Everything up to today on midterm

## Solid 

### Interface Segregation: Motivation 

- Several users of a class.  what happens if the class changes? 


## Dependency and Boundary Analysis

### Two kinds of Dependency 
- Control Dependency
	X calls Y, so X depends on Y 
- Source Dependency 
	X references a symbol in Y, so if Y changes, X must be recompiled 

### The Consequence 

- Downward pointing source dependencies complicates
	- Code maintenance 
	- Application development 
	- Support for variance 
	- support for patches and new versions 

### The Impact of Interfaces 
- Explicitly defined interfaces enable the designer to choose the direction of the source dependency independently of the calling direction

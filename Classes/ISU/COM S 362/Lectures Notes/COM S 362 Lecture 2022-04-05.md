### Command Pattern: Overview 

- Problem: You are creating a GUI and notice sequences of actions that are repeated for different inputs, for example, the user can save by clicking a button, going to the save menu. 
- Solution: encapsulate each action as a method in a Command class, the action can be preformed by calling the method.

##### Structure 

- invoker: uses the command by calling execute()
- Command: interface common to all supported commands 
- ConcreteCommand: has execute() method that preforms actions on the Receiver
- Receiver: the target of the command 
- Client: creates a ConcreteCommand and sets it in the Invoker 

### Observer: Overview 

pub sub

- Intent: 
	- Provide mechanism for objects to subscribe to information and other objects to publish information

##### Problem/Solution 

- Problem: You have an update event that might affect the state of multiple different objects, how to inform those objects of the event?
- If the source of the event directly calls the receivers, then it will be coupled to the receivers
- Solution: Create a Publisher 

##### Structure 

- Publisher: maintains a list of subscribers that it can notify
- Subscriber: interface for object that can receive updates 
- ConcreteSubscriber: wants to receive updates
- Client: adds subscribers to the publisher

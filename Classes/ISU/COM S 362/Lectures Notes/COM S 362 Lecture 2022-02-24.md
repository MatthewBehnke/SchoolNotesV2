### Liskov Substitution Principle 
- Created by Barbara Liskov in 1988
	- If for each object o1 of typ S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a sub type of T
Issue that it does not capture everything

- Suppose there are several users of a class and the users call non-overlapping subsets of the class's operations

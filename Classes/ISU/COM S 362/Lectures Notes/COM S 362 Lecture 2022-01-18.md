## First Day Stuff 

- No required textbook 
- No Late assignments 
- OOAD for short


## Slideshow 

### Analysis and design 
- Analysis is the process of understanding a problem and its potential solutions. 
- Design is the act of choosing a structure within which to organize the components of the solution.
### What do we mean by structure 
- Not
	-  data structures
	- control structures (if, else, white)
	- indentation and line spacing in the code
- Yes
	- How objects are associated with each other
	- What dependencies to objects have with other objects
	- Interfaces
	- How are the interfaces organized to provide extensions reuse and testing 
	- What are the responsibilities of objects and how are they assigned
### Why Design?
- A correct, but uninformative answer is that it is the topic of the class
- To really understand why design is important, we need to understand
	- What programmers do
	- what challenges programmers face 
	- how good design changes the challenge of programming
### What do developers really do 
- What percent of time is writing new code 
- What is the largest program you have written before 
### The reality of programming 
- Programmers spend 80% of their time modifying existing code
- Software systems are large 
- Software systems are complex
- the rate of change in software systems is rapidly accelerating 
- the risk of failure in large projects is significant 
- Software structure (design) often determines the difficulty of making a particular change
### How hard can it be 
- What is the largest project you have completed? 
- How many lines of code are in the software on a car? (100Million 2010)
### Software challenges
- 60 - 80% of development is maintenance / evolution of existing products
	- How do developers understand million lines programs well enough to reliably modify or extend them
	- how do we preserve design integrity over the life of a product. How do future maintainers acquire an understanding of the designers intent
### What is design 
- Design assumes we know the problem and that we believe the problem to be solvable and that we intend to solve it 
- Given that, Design answers the question: What code should we write? How should it be organized? What is our strategy for ensuring it meets our business objectives?
- Design is about where each piece of implantation ...
### What design is not 
- style 
- when 
- behaves 
- efficiency
- aesthetics
- algorithms 
- computability 
-  language 
-  management
### The Goals of good design 
- To facilitate 
	- change 
	- understanding 
	- testing 
	- development
### Fundamental Principles of Design 
- Abstraction
	- Denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguishes it from all other kinds of objects, relative to the prospective of the viewer 
- Information Hiding (Encapsulation)
	- Separates the interface of an abstraction from its implementation, hiding all secrets of an object that do not contribute to its essential characteristics 
- Separation of Concerns 
	- Design choices related to separate concerns are in separate locations
### Objectives of this course 
- Develop appropriate skills through practice as well as knowledge 
- Develop fluency in domain terminology 
- Be able to apply design patterns and common heuristics 
- Be familiar with the context form which current design emerged 

### To Succeed in this course 
- You must be able:
	- To identify bad code 
	- to identify what design principles the code violates 
	- to explain what problems each violation might create 
	- to propose a reasonable cost strategy for improvement

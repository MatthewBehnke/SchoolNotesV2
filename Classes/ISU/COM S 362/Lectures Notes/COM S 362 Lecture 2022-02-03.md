### Responsibility Driven Design

Working to create designs that conform to the fundamental design principles, Software Engineers came to realize easily maintained objects tend to:
- Have a narrow scope 
- Have well defined, closely related responsibilities 
- Often model entities and concepts in the problem space 

Note "Coherent" just means "strongly related" or "naturally belonging together" 
- Each set of responsibilities is discovered by looking at interactions among "candidate classes"
- Later these responsibilities will typically become properties or member functions of the containing class
- Two sets of heuristics for identifying and grouping responsibilities 
	- GRASP
	- SOLID

### Noun Phrase Analysis 

- Nouns identify "people, places, or things" (including concepts)
- Objects model things and concepts 
- Noun-Phrase analysis exploits this similarity by using nouns in some textural description of the system or a part of the system to create an initial list of  "candidate classes"

### Verbs are helpful too ....
- Verbs describe actions and imply actions

### SOLID 
- Single Responsibility 
- Open-Closed Principle 
- Liskov Substitution Principle 
- Interface Segregation Principe 
- Dependency Inversion Principle 

- Designed by uncle bob

### Single Responsibility Principle 

- Similar to separation of Concerns 
- Separation of Concerns 
	- Separate an application into distance sections, so each section addresses a separate concern
	- Single Responsibility Principle 
		- A module should have one, and only one, reason to change 
		- A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor 

### Why do dependencies matter

Dependencies are a significant contributor to code complexity 

We should identify and scrutinize dependencies carefully 

Design is about managing dependencies 


### The Dependency Inversion Principle 

- Observation: abstraction (interfaces) tend to be stable, concrete classes tend to be volatile 
- We want to depend on things that are stable, not volatile 
- Dependency Inversion Principle: the most flexible systems are those in which dependencies refer only to abstractions (e.g. interfaces and abstract classes), not to concretions (concrete classes) 

### Dependency Inversion Refactoring Steps 

- Create an interface
- Make the service class implement the interface 
- use the interface 


### The open closed principle 

- Coined by Bertrand Meyer in 1988 
	- Open for extension but closed for modification 
- We want to extend new features without having to rewrite existing code


- Separate the things that change for different reasons 
- Organize dependencies 
	- Protect higher level components from change to lower level components

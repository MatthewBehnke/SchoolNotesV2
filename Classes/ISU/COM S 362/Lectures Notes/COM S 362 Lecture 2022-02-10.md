### Grasp 

- General Responsibility Assignment Software Patters 
	- Pattern principles for assigning responsibilities to software classes
	- A responsibility driven design aid 
	- helps understand object oriented design
	- domain model is inspiration for design model software objects 

### Responsibilities 

Two general kinda* of responsibilities
	- Doing 
	- Knowing 
Doing: 
	- Doing something itself 
	- Initiating action in other objects
	- Controlling and coordinating actives in other objects
Knowing:
	- Knowing about private encapsulated data
	- Knowing about related objects
	- Knowing about things it can derive or calculate 

### Information Expert 

Assign a responsibility to the class that has the information needed to fulfill it 


### Creator 

Why creates X? 

Class B is a good candidate for the responsibility of creating A if one or more of these is true:
	- B contains or aggregates A
	- B has the initializing data for A
	- B records A
	- B closely uses A

### Controller 

- Question: What is the first object beyond the UI layer that receives and coordinates a system event 
- System event: event generated by external actor
- Maintaining independence (decoupling) between UI and application control is a basic design pattern (MVC)
- Assign the controller responsibility to either 
	- A class representing the overall system, device, or subsystem (facade controller
	- A class that represents a use case scenario within which the system event occurs (use case controller)

### Use Case
- Use cases are written stories 
- Describe an actor's interaction with the system
- Not a diagram, not pseudocode, not logic

### Use Case Diagrams 

- Use case diagrams show the associations between actors and use cases for a system

### Domain Model

- Visualization concept or mental models of a real world domain
- Not software classes / objects
- Used for communicating with domain experts 

### Responsibilities and interaction diagrams 

- Key skill of object-oriented design is assigning responsibilities 
- Collaboration described in interaction diagrams 
	- Sequence 
	- Communication diagrams 

### Design Class Diagrams 

- The design class diagrams show software classes
- OO design support  a low representational gap between software components and the domain 

### Up Artifacts 

- Diagram indicates how artifacts inform each other, but it does not imply sequential execution of project.

### Use Case Definitions 

- Stakeholders: Anyone with an interest in or an effect on the outcome of the product / project 
- Actors: Anything outside of the system (typically people) with a behavior. A source of triggering events 
- Requirements: Capabilities and conditions to which the system must conform
- Use Case: Tax Documents. Collection of related scenarios 
- Scenarios: A description of an actor or actors using the system to support a goal. The primary source of requirements

### Analysis Definitions 

- Requirements 
	- Capabilities and conditions to which the system must conform
- Stakeholders
	- Anyone with an interest in the project

- Use case 
	- Text Documents A collection of related scenarios 
- Scenarios 
	- A description of an actor or actors using the system to support a goal 

### Artifacts of Analysis 

- List of stakeholders
- List of Actors / Users 
- List of Trigger Events 
- Collection of draft requirements 
- Collection of Scenarios 
- Use Case "Model" and diagram
- System Sequence Diagram
- Domain model with associations 
- Domain model with collaboration / communication diagrams

### Analysis Activities 

- Identify use cases/scenarios
	- Through events, actors, goals 
- Clarify boundary of application
	- Negotiate with stakeholders 
- Elaborate / clarify most valuable scenarios
- Identify objects and concepts 
	- Tentative assignment of rough responsibilities 
- Identify relationships among objects 
- Validate objects / responsibilities against scenarios 

###  Use Case 
- Text stories 
- Use to discover and record requirements 
- Make it easy for domain experts and stakeholders to participate in requirements collection 

- Template
	- Primary Actor 
	- Triggering Event 
	- Success Guarantee
	- Precondition
	- Main Success Scenario
	- Extensions / Alternatives

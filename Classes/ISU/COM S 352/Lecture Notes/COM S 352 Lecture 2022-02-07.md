### Exception Handling 

Memory access out of bound results in a trap 

OS typically terminates process 

### Segmentation

Base and bound means direct translation from address space to physical memory 

Assumes program knows in advance how much dynamic memory will be required 

Growing process's memory dynamically is very difficult 


### Problem 

What happens when address space is full

Using base and bound, process needs to be copied to larger region in memory 

All pointers to stack need to be updated

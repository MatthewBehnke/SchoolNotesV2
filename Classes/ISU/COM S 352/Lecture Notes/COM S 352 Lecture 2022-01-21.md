## The Abstraction: The process 

### Program  vs Process 

- A program is instructions stored on disk 
	- An executable file 
- A process is a running program 

### Process Creation
- Load
	- Program into a memory address space 
	-  [[Heap]] into memory 
	-  [[Stack]] into memory 

### Process Information 
- A process is more that a list of instructions, execution requires knowing 
	- Which instruction to execute next 
		- Program counter 
	- What is the immediate data on which instructions operate 
		- [[Registers]]
	- Where are the instructions and data stored in memory 
		- [[Address space]] 
	- How to find parameters of current functions 
		- [[Stack pointer]] 
		- [[Frame pointer]]
	- Etc 
		- open files 
		- threads 
### Process Control Block / Process in execution
- Address space 
	- code
	- static data
	- [[Heap]] 
	- [[Stack]]
- Process struct 
	- process id 
	- state 
		- RUNNING
		
### Scheduler: Running and Ready 

The scheduler is part of the operating system, it's job is to manage the process' states. Only one process running at a tome (Single core assumption)
Other processes that are ready to execute go in a ready [[queue]]

### Multi-programming 

- Processes need to preform I/O, e.g, disk read/write
- Consider a process that makes a random read from disk 
	- Hard drive latency 10 ms and SSD latency 1ms
	- CPU clock 0.3 ns cycle and 3 instructions per cycle 

Not a good use of the CPU

Multi-programming is letting the user run mutiple programs ( processes) together. 
When one process needs to wait for I/O we let the CPU run other programs 

### Scheduler with BLocked State

When a process is waiting for I/O is placed in the blocked state. Next process in ready queues is set to running

### Contex Switch 

Save CPU context of de-scheduled process 
Load CPU context of scheduled process 

### Parents 

- Every process must have a parent 
- Initially the parent is the process that created it (the child process )
- When a process is created it starts in an initial state and when it terminates it goes to a final (zombie) state
- The final state is required because we cant't delete the PCB immediately, the parent may want information such as the exit code 

### Process System Calls 

[[POSIX]] (Portable Operating System Interface)
- Standard programming interface provided by UNIX like systems 

### Fork() // Process Creation 

```pid_t fork(void);```

- Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process 
- Child process has a copy of parent's address space 
- On success: 
	- Both parent and child continue execution at the point of return from fork()
	- Returns pid of the child process to the parent 
- On failure
	- todo 

### Wait() // Wait for Child 

```pid_t wait(int *wstatus*);```

- Suspend execution of the parent until one of its children terminates on success:
	- Returns pid of the child process that terminated 
	- wstatus is populated with information about the way the child process terminated 
- If a process has terminated, but parent has not yet called wait(), the process becomes a zombie process 
- if the parent terminated without calling wait(), the process becomes an orphan, and a system process (systemd on linux) becomes the parent.

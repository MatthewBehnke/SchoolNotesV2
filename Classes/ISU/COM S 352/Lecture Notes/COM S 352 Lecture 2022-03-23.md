### Interrupts 

- Without interrupts - P means CPU is in polling (spinning ) loop 
- With Interrupts - CPU can be switched to running process w during I/O


### Direct Memory Access (DMA)

- Without DMA - C means CPU is copying 
- With DMA - the cpu can delegate the copying and free up the cpu for another process 

### Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
HDD have been main form of persistent data storage for decades 

Most of file systems were developed around their behavior 

Later we will see what different design are made based on Solid State Drive (SSD)

### Interface 

The interface for a drive is visualized by the drive's controller

From software perspective the address space of the drive is divided into 512 byte blocks called sectors 

Writing to a block is atomic 
	Either write to block fully succeeds or it doesn't change anything 
	No partial write to block, even if power goes out in the middle 

Multi sector reads and writes are supported, but no guarantee of atomicity 
	if power goes out during multi-sector writes, torn write possible 
	Software needs to handle torn writes 

### Geometry 
- Platter:  circular hard surface were data is stored using magnetic persistence 
- Surface: a platter has a top and bottom surface, both can store data
- Track: a single circle around the center, a surface consists of thousands of tracks 
- Spindle: the center of the platter which connects to a motor 
- Disk Arm: moves the head across the plater to select a specific track 
- Disk Head: transforms the magnetic field into electrical current 

### Latencies
- Rotational delay: time for sector to rotate under the disk head 
- Seek time: the for disk arm to change position to the correct track

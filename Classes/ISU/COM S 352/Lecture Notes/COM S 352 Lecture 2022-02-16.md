### Swap

The OS can take advantage of large slow disk space to give illusion of large address space

### Present Bit 

Page table has a present bit to indicate if a page is in physical memory (1) or swap (0)

### What to do when page not present 

When program tries to access memory that is on a page currently in swap a page fault occurs 

The page fault is just a trap, it is dealt with by the OS code called the page-fault handler

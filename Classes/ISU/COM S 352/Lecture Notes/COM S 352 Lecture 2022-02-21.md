### Replacement Policy 

Cache and swap 

FIFO would be a good choice in theory but in practice it suffers from Belady's anomaly . 

### Reference Strings

We will examine the performance of policies for specific memory access patters called <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">page reference strings</mark> 

### Comparison To Optimal 

Base line to compare against

Optimal (OPT) assume we can predict the future and always choose to evict the page that will be used furthest out (or any page that will never be used again)

### FIFO 

FIFO - evict the page that has been in memory the longest 

Easy to implement and fast(O(1) operations) can be implemented in a fixed  cache using a circular buffer

### Belady's Anomaly 

We would expect larger cache to preform better as  smaller cache 

FIFO has a strange corner case known as Belady's Anomaly, where sometimes a larger cache does worse 


### Random

Evict a page at random

Advantages:
- Easy to implement
- no  corner cases (not influenced by order of pages)


### LRU

Least recently used - evict the page used the least recently

Advantage:
- Better performance than FIFO
- No Belady's anomaly possibly 
Disadvantage: slow, accounting to do on every page

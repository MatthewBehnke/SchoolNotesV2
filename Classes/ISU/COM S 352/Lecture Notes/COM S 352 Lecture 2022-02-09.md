### Sharing 

Protection registers can enable sharing 

### Free Memory 

Segments are in contiguous regions of physical memory 

To allocate a new segment, OS must keep  a list of free memory 

Simple solution is a linked list of free regions of memory 

### Paging 

Segmentation made code, stack and heap independently relocatable 

Segments can become arbitrarily large contiguous regions of memory

Resulted in external fragmentation 

### Page Table 

One page table for each process 

Virtual Page Number (VPN) is the index of the page table 
Physical Frame Number (PFN) points to the frame in physical memory 

### Virtual Address Bits

virtual address divided into VPN and offset 

### Virtual Address VPN Bit Size

If total address space is 2^m bytes and page size is 2^n bytes then 
VPN is m-n bits
offset is n bits

### Physical Address Bits

If physical memory is 2^m bytes and page size is 2^n bytes 
PFN is m-n bits
offset is n bites

PhysAddr = PFN * frame_size + offset 

PhysAddr = (PFN << NUM_OFFSET_BITS) | offset

Total physical memory and address space size may not be the same 

### Address Translation 


### Unused Pages 

Unused pages don't need to be mapped to physical memory 

Process is unaware of pages, when it requests more memory allocated for heap or stack the OS maps pages as needed 


### Free Memory Management

Os needs to know which frames are not use, simple method is linked list 

No external fragmentation - no unusable gaps between frames 

Pages can have internal fragmentation - unused portion of page

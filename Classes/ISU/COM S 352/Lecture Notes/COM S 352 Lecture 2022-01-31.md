### Problem Starvation

What happens if we have a lot of I/O bound jobs? 

The long jobs can't make progress because it faces starvation 

### Priority Boost

- Rule 5: After some time period S, Move all the jobs in the system to the topmost queue 

### Problem: Gaming the System

Smart programmers will catch on: "I can make my application run faster if I never let a complete quanta expire"

### Optimization: Lower Priority, Longer Quanta

Longer quanta in the lower queues can reduce frequency of context switches 

### Fair Scheduling 

We have seen how schedulers can optimize turnaround and response time 

But we have also seen issues such as starvation that result in some process getting little run time, even while the overall system has good turnaround and response time 

### Lottery Scheduler 

Each job assigned numbed tickets 

Every time slice, scheduler randomly picks a winning ticket and the job runs for that time slice 

Over time, jobs run time is proportional to percent of tickets held.

### How to Assign Tickets 

If effect, the lottery scheduler is a kind of priority scheduler
 - More tickets higher priority 
 - But, fairer than priority, low ticket jobs can't be completely starved

Disadvantage 
over shorter periods of time can get unlucky 


### Stride Scheduling 

Lottery has good fairness over the long run, but randomness can result in sub optimal chose's over a short time

Stride scheduling is deterministic (no random) but has same fairness 


### Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)

CFS gives a production of CPU time to each process, there are two questions 

When to preempt the currently running process?
	Every process assigned a time slice within one sched_latency
			If equal priority, each process gets 1/N slice of sched_latency 
			Therefor, every process should run at least once in sched_latency 

Which process to run next?
	Tie process with the smallest virtual runtime (vruntime)

	
### Being Nice 

Nice value set by user to indicate "priority", weights the 1/N time slice a process gets before preemption time_slick_k = weight_k / (sum of all processes weights ) * sched_latency 

Scheduler accumulates virtual run time (vruntime), which is a weighted version of the real runtime of each process 

When the current running process uses its time_slice_k, or leaves fir some other reason scheduler pricks process with lowest vruntime to run next 

When blocked process goes to ready queue, its vruntime is set to smallest vruntime of currently running or runn-able process

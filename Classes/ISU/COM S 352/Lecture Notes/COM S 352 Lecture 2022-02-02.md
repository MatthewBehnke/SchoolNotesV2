### Efficiency

Scheduler gets called often, efficiency matters 

CFS uses red-black tree (Self balancing binary search tree) to quickly find process with lowest vruntime.


### Address Space 

Processes must share main memory, we must account for processes 
- created and destroyed 
- requesting more memory during execution
- requesting more memory than is physically available

### Single Program

Main memory divided between the OS and user program

Addresses assigned statically (at compile time)

still used in simple (single program) embedded systems

### Multi-programming 

Processes share main memory 

Simplest scheme is to assign contiguous regions of memory 

Becomes costly when a process needs to grow its memory

### Page Size

Trade off 
	- Small page size means bigger page table 
	- Bigger page size means more internal fragmentation 

Typical page size if 8KB in Linux 

### Concern 

Each process has its own page table which the OS stores in frames in physical memory 

Linux page size is 8KB meaning a address space of 140 TB
~ 17 million page table entries for every process

Linux reduces size with multi-level (3-level tree structure) page tables

### Free Space Management

Paging simplifies free-space management because free space is divided into fixed size units 

Free space management made difficult when allowing variable sized unit because of external fragmentation

### Basics of the Heap 

Heap is managed at user level, provided by language libraries
- In C malloc() and free()
- In java New and the garbage collector 

Program becomes owner of allocated memory, the allocated space in memory can not be moved by the heap manage after allocation 

That means technique of  compaction is not possible for the heap 

### Tracking Allocated regions 

Each allocated region has a header to track its size 

- size: number of types allocated to the program 
- magic: a secret number that can be checked to verify the start of a region, otherwise user could cal free() on address that are not actually allocated regions

### Embedding the Free List into the Heap 

The free list is stored in a linked list data structure 

- head: a pointer to the first free region of memory 
- next points to the next free region of memory or 0 if at last region 

Because the free list is dynamic in size it is convenient to put in the heap

### System Call Example 

Library functions like printf typically have some coed that executes in user mode, then it makes one or more system calls


User Mode: printf -> write() -> ecall -> Kernel Mode: sys_write -> return_from_trap -> User Mode

### Scheduling 

- The workload of a system consists of many processes with often different and conflicting requirements and user expectations 
- Some processes just want a lot of CPU time, while others require a quick response to I/O, and users expect applications to be responsive 

### Jobs 

- Real processes alternate between needing CPU time and waiting for I/O
- We call time when process needs CPU time a job (CPU burst)
- The time when process needs to wait is a I/O burst

### Jobs With Time-Sharing 

- A scheduler may not let a process complete it's job in one run on the CPU
- On time-sharing systems, the scheduler may preempt a process, swapping it with a different process before it has completed its job

### Metrics

- $T_{arriveal}$ - time when job first enters ready state
- $T_{completion}$ - time when job finishes 
- $T_{firstrun}$ - time when job starts its first run on the CPU

### Metric: Turnaround Time
- The time to complete a job
- $T_{turnaround}$ = $T_{completion}$ - $T_{arrival}$ 

### Metric: Response Time 
- The time to first execution on CPU
- $T_{responce}$ = $T_{firstrun}$ - $T_{arrival}$ 

### Why Different Metrics

- Turnaround time tells time to complete jobs, good for CPU bound processes, where getting enough CPU runtime is the main concern
- Response time tells how long to respond to I/O, good for I/O bound (interactive) processes, which have short CPU bursts and frequent I/O 

### Policy: FIFO
- Implementation: First in First out queue
- Preemption: None 
- Advantage: easy to implement 

### Problems with FIFO
- Performance depends on arrival order, large upfront CPU bursts can hurt turnaround and response time for other processes 


### Shortest Job First (SJF)

- Implementation: Priority queue sorted by job length 
- Preemption: None 
- Advantage: Optimal average turnaround and response time when all jobs arrive at same time 
### Problems with SJF

- When happens if a short job arrives after starting a long job
- Back to high turnaround and response time

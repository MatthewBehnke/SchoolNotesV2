Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to:
1) the scientific process within the geosciences;
2) basics of water quality and watershed concepts;
3) equipment you will use during your semester-long research projects; and
4) methods for recording data and observations.
```
**Part 1**
The first three lab exercises of the semester will help you prepare for your team’s research project. Your
task for today, as a geoscientist, is to consider the various metrics of water quality in preparation for
field data collection in a future lab. We will also explore how confounding variables are introduced into
a scientific study and may affect measurements and results.

```
First, let’s consider the following question:
How do various water quality metrics indicate whether water is uncontaminated and safe to drink?
```
```
Nitrite (NO 2 ) and Nitrate (NO 3 )
Nitrite: ≤ 1 mg/L (EPA drinking water standard)
Nitrate: ≤ 10 mg/L (EPA drinking water standard); 5.8 mg/L (Iowa stream average).
Note: Nitrite has a short lifespan in surface water and will quickly oxidize into nitrate. Noticeable
amounts of nitrite usually means water was sampled near a local source of contamination.
Potential Health Effects: Potentially fatal blood disorder in infants if left untreated.
Common sources of nitrite/nitrate:
Runoff from fertilizer use; leaking from septic tanks, sewage; and erosion of natural deposits.
```
```
pH
6.5 – 8.5 (EPA secondary standard); 8.2 (Iowa stream average)
Common anthropogenic effects on water pH:
acid precipitation, agricultural runoff, wastewater discharge or industrial runoff.
```
```
Chloride (Cl)
≤ 250 mg/L (EPA secondary standard); 22 mg/L (Iowa stream average)
Common anthropogenic sources: Wastewater discharge, road salting, or agricultural runoff.
```
```
Water Hardness
Water hardness is a function of the amount of dissolved calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). There are
no known harmful health impacts of hard water. The United States Geological Survey recognizes
hardness values ≥ 120 mg/L as being “hard” or “very hard”.
```
```
Hardness is due water dissolving rocks and sediment. Consequently, groundwater has a higher hardness
than surface runoff.
```
```
Phosphate (PO 4 )
0.10 mg/L (EPA recommendation for freshwater environments); 0.2 mg/L (Iowa stream average)
Potential Health Effects: High concentrations hinder removal of microorganisms from drinking water
Common anthropogenic sources: agricultural runoff or wastewater discharge.
```

**Part 2**
Imagine that your team forms a research question regarding the size of a **watershed** and water
chemistry within that watershed based on the following observations:
A) Water chemistry is affected by agricultural runoff and waste runoff (e.g., sewage).
B) Ioway Creek watershed drains both farmland and urban areas.
C) The size of a watershed can be quantified by the area (km2) of its catchment (i.e., the area of land
that collects precipitation in the watershed).

```
Your team suspects that as more and more farmland and urban areas are drained by Ioway Creek and its
tributaries, the quality of that water should decrease.
```
These observations lead your team to form a more general hypothesis:
**As the catchment area of a stream and its tributaries increases, water quality decreases, too.**

```
One member of your team has taken water samples from five locations in the Ioway Creek watershed
and has measured the catchment area of all streams that occur upstream from each of the sampling
locations.
```
Please see the sheet provided by your TA for his/her field notes regarding each water sample. A map of
the sample collections site is shown at the end of the lab handout.

```
Questions
```
1. Assuming that the hypothesis is true, what are specific predictions you can make about how pH,
nitrite/nitrate, chloride, water hardness, and phosphate measurements will change as stream length
increases?

```
pH:
```
```
Nitrite/Nitrate:
```
```
Chloride:
```
```
Water hardness:
```
```
Phosphate:
```

2. Assuming that the hypothesis is true, which sample(s) do you think will be the most different from
the others? Explain your reasoning.
3. Besides catchment area from each of the localities, how do the samples differ from each other based
on the field notes? How could these differences affect the results of your water chemistry tests?


4. It is time to measure the water chemistry of each sample! You will only need ~75 mL of each sample.

Follow your TA’s instructions and the instructions on your water testing kits to complete the following table:

```
Sample Name
```
```
Catchment area (km^2 )
```
```
pH
```
```
Nitrite (mg/L)
```
```
Nitrate (mg/L)
```
```
Chloride (mg/L)
```
```
Hardness (mg/L)
```
```
Phosphate (mg/L)
```
```
Notes
```

5. Were all of your predictions correct based on your measurements? If not, briefly describe any
differences between your predictions and the results of your measurements.
6. What could be potential reasons for the differences between your predictions and your results?
7. Confounding variables are variables that a researcher failed to control for during an experiment or
study. When a researcher fails to remove such confounding variables, measurements and analyses can
be affected, leading one to incorrectly accept or reject a hypothesis. Consistent sampling and
measurement techniques are a good first step in removing confounding variables. How could
consistency in sampling and measuring be improved in this activity?

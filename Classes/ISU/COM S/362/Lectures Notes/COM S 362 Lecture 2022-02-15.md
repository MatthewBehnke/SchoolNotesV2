## Interaction Diagrams 

### Unified Modeling Language 

Visual language for analysis and design

General Purpose 
- Not specific to  a programming language 
- Primary used for ood but not exclusive 

Standardized 
- UML is the standard language for OO design

Adaptable 
- Several different types of diagrams 
- Allows user to chose level of diagram detail 

### When and how to use UML

UML is used in various contexts and levels of detail
	- Quick whiteboard sketch
	- Detailed documentation of design 


### Interaction Diagrams 

The domain model diagram is static (structural) - describes classes and relationships 

Interactive diagrams describe collaboration over time 

Interactive diagrams are used in both domain modeling and in design 

Interaction diagrams describe groups of objects collaborating 

Show ""messages" passed between objects, can be interpreted as:
	- method calls 
	- asynchronous network message

Communication Diagram - simpler, emphasizes object relationships 

Sequence Diagram - more detailed, visual diagram 

### When to use Interaction Diagrams

Use sequence diagrams to look at the behavior of several objects within a single use case 

Use communication diagrams when working on a whiteboard 

Use sequence diagrams when creating a more though out diagram

### Class Diagram

The class diagram is static ( structural ) - describes classes, interfaces and associations 


Different levels of details can be included, e.g., the domain model is simplified class diagram describing conceptual class


Class diagram is typically the ultimate design artifact, there is a class mapping between class diagram and code.

### When to use class diagrams 

Top down - explore and document design choices before code 

Bottom up - document and understand existing code 

### 4(3) Levels of Association 

- Dependency - class A uses class B in some way ( dashed arrow )
- Association - class A has some connection to instance(s) of class B ( solid arrow)
- Aggregation - more than an association, but less than a composition (not really used) ( solid arrow with cube on the other end)
- Composition - an object if class B cannot exist without class A (solid arrow with solid cube)

## Complexity and the Object Model 

### Encapsulation and Information Hiding 

- "Encapsulation" is the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation servers to separate the contractual interface for an abstraction and its implementation. 
	- Translation: Hide the secrets and provide an interface for the abstraction 
- Goal: Keep changes local 
- information is  more than data, it includes state, structure and behavior 

### Modularity 

- "Modularity" is the property of a system that has been decomposed into a set of cohesive and loosely coupled modules
	- Make modules that don't depend much on each other and where the internals naturally belong together
- Goal: Make changeable and reusable modules

### Loosely Coupled 

- Question: How should one module depend on another 
- Keep dependencies between modules small, change in one module should not affect change in others 
- Modules have interfaces 
	- The interface should  expose only abstraction 

### High Cohesion 

- Question: What goes into a module? 

### Hierarchy 

- "Hierarchy" is a ranking or ordering of abstractions 
	- With modularity we determined which abstractions go together, with hierarchy we give abstractions an ordering from most generic to most specific
   - Main types 
		- has-a
		- is-a

### Design Principle: Separation of Concerns 

- Separation of Concerns means design choices related to separate concerns are in separate locations 
- Goal: Separate responsibilities so that each module is more cohesive, reduce the impact of change 


## Reading Code Smells 

### Code Smells 

- Code smells are indications that code could be improved 
- There are no precise metrics 
- Good judgment is required, the code smell just means there is something that should get your attention 

### Refactoring 

- refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior 
- The goal of refactoring is to improve the design without changing the behavior 
- Refactoring is making incremental changes to existing code 
- Refactoring is not rewriting the code 

### Duplicate Code 

- Duplicate Code is a sign of lacking abstraction
- It hurts understand-ability and maintainability of the code 
- When you read duplicate code you have to be careful to check for intentional or nonidentical differences 

### Long Parameter List 

- If you need to provide a function with a lot of arguments it may be that 
	- The function is not following the rule of "do one thing" and suffers from separation of concerns
	- The parameters should be part of an abstraction 

### Primitive Obsession 

- Using primitives makes change more difficult 
- We use them for efficiency, but we should use abstraction to hide them 

### Large Class
- Sign of violating separation of concerns 
- A class should not be assigned too many different responsibilities 
- Many also be opportunity to introduce a hierarchy, separate code into multiple sub classes

 ### Data Class

 - A class with only fields and getters and setters 
 - Many be a sign of poor encapsulation

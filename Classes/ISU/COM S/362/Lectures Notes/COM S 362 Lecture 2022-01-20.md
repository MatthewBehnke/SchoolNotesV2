## [[COM S 362 Readings Week 1]]

Went over the importance of the readings assigned for the week

## Code example 

https://canvas.iastate.edu/courses/87069/files/17412630?module_item_id=4133449

Went over why the example code has bad design. 
- Not OOP
- Duplicated code 
- Tiny methods 

### [[Bottom-up Completion]]

The idea that we are changing the organization and structure of the code so we can get closer to being able to add new features when needed  

## Example Problem: KWIC Index 

- Key Word in context (KWIC) used to list sections of text containing key words 
- Problem: KWIC index system inputs ordered lines and outputs a listing of all circular shifts of all lines in alphabetical order 

### Natural way to solve 

break up into methods 
- input 
- circularShift
- alphabetize 
- output 

bad things about this 
- No encapsulation of the data inputs to each module 
- hard to change code 

## Modularization 

- Changeability 
- Independent Development 
- Comprehensibility 

## Information Hiding 

- No part of a complex system should depend on the internal details of any other part. 
- Only let the user know what they need to know

## Industrial Strength Software 
- Software that is inherently complex enough that an individual developer can not comprehend all the subtleties of it's design
- Examples  / reasons
	- Real time 
	- Concurrency 
	- Dependability 
	- Security 

## Complexity 
- Essential Complexity: How hard something is to do, regardless of how experienced you are, what tools you have or what new and flashy architecture pattern you used to solve the problem. Some things are just hard and take a ling time. 
- Accidental Complexity: Complexity that is the result of things like tools and languages we use.
- Even if we remove all accidental complexity with better tools, the essential complexity remains.
- We cannot remove essential complexity, the best we can do is manage it with good design.

## Abstraction
- An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer 
	- Translation: Distinguishes important from unimportant details, depends on the perspective of the user 
- Goal: Reduce complexity

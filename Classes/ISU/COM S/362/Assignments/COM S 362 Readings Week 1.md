# [[COM S 362]] Readings Week 1

In the first week of class, we will be reading a couple of classic papers that played a significant role on our understanding of software design. It is difficult to appreciate the importance of design principles without having the historical context for what software was like before they existed. Because software is a fast changing field, some examples in these papers are archaic, but the design principles are still relevant today.

1.

- [x] [Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, 1995. (Links to an external site.)](https://iowa-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01IASU_ALMA51325831780002756&context=L&vid=01IASU&lang=en_US&search_scope=ComboPrimocentral&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,the%20Mythical%20Man-Month&offset=0)

Read Chapter 16 "No Silver Bulletâ€”Essence and Accident in Software Engineering".

Description: Why do we care about design? Software projects aren't that hard for a good programmer, right? What about new IDEs, will they make programming so easy that design is irrelevant? Read this famous essay on what makes software complex. Pay attention to the distinction between essential and non-essential complexity.

2.

- [x] Option 1: [D.L. Parnas. On the criteria to be used in decomposing systems into modules, 1972. (Links to an external site.)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361598.361623)

- [x] Option 2: [David Gries. Information Hiding and Encapsulation. 2018. (Links to an external site.)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/JavaAndDS/files/infoHiding.pdf) 

Description: In this seminal paper, Parnas describes information hiding, a design principle not only found in the OO concept of encapsulation but throughout design. The examples in the paper are archaic to modern developers, the one page summary by Gries may help.

3.

- [x] [Grady Booch, Robert A. Maksimchuk, Michael W. Engle, Bobbi J. Young, Jim Conallen, and Kelli A. Houston. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, Third Edition, 2007. (Links to an external site.)](https://iowa-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01IASU_ALMA51326651020002756&context=L&vid=01IASU&lang=en_US&search_scope=ComboPrimocentral&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=default_tab&query=any,contains,object-oriented%20analysis%20and%20design%20with%20applicaitons&sortby=date&facet=frbrgroupid,include,85625898&offset=0)

Read Chapter 2 starting at "The Meaning of Abstraction" and stop before "The Meaning of Typing", pp. 41-64.

Description: Grady Booch is one of the founders of UML. Watch for his descriptions of the key design principles: abstraction, encapsulation, information hiding, separation of concerns, modularity and hierarchy.

## Dependability of memory systems

Metrics that can be used 

- MTTF - mean time to failure 
- MTTR - mean time to repair 


Availability = MTTF / (MTTR  + MTTF)

The 9s of availability 

One 9 - 90% (36.5 days of downtime / year)
Two 9s - 99% ( 3.7 days of downtime / year )
Three 9s - 99.9% ( 9 hours of downtime / year )
Four 9s - 99.99% ( 1 hour of downtime / year )
Five 9s - 99.999% ( 6 minutes of downtime / year )



## Error Detection and Correction 

Parity - One bit per some region of memory (stores the evenness of the number of 1 in the region). Used to detect single bit errors (or any odd number bit errors). 

EEC - error checking codes 

H/W algo that allow direction and correction of errors

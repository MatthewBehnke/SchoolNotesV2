## [[Program Performance]]

Continued on program performance 

```

int a[100]

for	(i = 0; i < 100; i++) 
	a[i] = i;
	
```

On the first loop it has to pull from main memory but it also pulls in [[cache line]] making the next loops much master because it does not have to access the main memory. It instead just pulls from the cache. 

## [[Locality]]

Talked about temporal and spatial Locality

## Example of a data hazard  

| 1   | ADD | X9  | X10 | X11 |     
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | ADD | X12 | X9  | X12 |     

|     | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  | c5  | c6  | c7  | c8  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |     |     |     |
| 2   |     | IF  | ID  | --- | --- | EX  | MEM | WB  | 

\--- means bubble in the pipeline or a stall because there is nothing to do 

showed that a data hazard can stall a pipeline because it has to wait for information to be available.

Hazard - An event that forces a pipeline to stall.
Data Hazard - Hazard caused by unavailable data.

## Write Back 

| 1   | ADD | X9  | X10 | X11 |     
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | ADD | X12 | X9  | X12 |     

|     | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  | c5  | c6  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |     |
| 2   |     | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |

There has to be a data path out of the execute path and into another execute path

If there where three instructions

| 1   | ADD | X9  | X10 | X11 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | SUB | X15 | X16 | X17 |
| 3   | ADD | X10 | X9  | X12 | 

 |     | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  | c5  | c6  | c7  |
 | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 | 1   | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |     |     |
 | 2   |     | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |     |
 | 3   |     |     | IF  | ID  | EX  | MEM | WB  |

Only allowed because of write back otherwise we would have to insert a bubble and wait 

## Write Back from the MEM to Ex

| 1   | LDUR | X10 | \[X0 | #0] |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- |
| 1   | ADDI | X0  | X0   | #1  | 


|     | c1  | c2  | c3  | c4  | c5  | c6  | c7  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | IF  | ID  | Ex  | MEM | WB  |     |     |
| 2   |     | IF  | ID  | --- | EX  | MEM | WB  |

We can draw a line from MEM to EX bypassing the need to wait for the write back stage. If this data pipeline does not exist then we have to input another bubble.

Only allowed when there is a data pipeline from the ALU to the Execution stage

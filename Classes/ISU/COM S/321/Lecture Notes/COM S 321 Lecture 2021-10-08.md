## Cont of Data Hazards

X = Y + Z
W = Z + V

Just with the one change of swapping 3 and 4 it allows us to cut down two cycles with no bubbles. 




## Control Hazard

Occurs when branching processor does not know what address to fetch. 

Are we branching and where are we branching to?

## Branch prediction

Takes a guess about weather or not a branch is taken, or abotu where a branch 

possible algos 
- Static 
	- All branches taken 
	- All branches not taken
	- Forward taken backward not taken
	- ***Backward taken forward not taken** 
		- This is much better than chance because of loops
- Dynamic
	- Branch prediction buffers
		- Also known as a branch district table
		- To implement
			- Data structure indexed by the lower order bits of the instructions address 
			- Each table row contains 1 bit
				- 0 if the branch was taken last time 
				- 1 if it was taken last time
	- 

If we mispredict a branch then we just Invalidate the instructions by turning on the writes.

# COM S 321 Lecture 2021-10-15

Right now we have our instructions of length 32 but we are running a 64 bit arch. We use packets to combine two instructions together to form a  64 bit instruction. 


Talked about how two instruction packets are implemented in hardware. Basically two parallel paths one for each instruction. But one stops after the ALU and the other saves to memory.

Now that we have 64 bit instructions all of our binary ALU instructions must be 64 bit wide. We just add a bunch of 0's to the start to pad the length to the most significant side. Then we apply ones or two complement. 


## What hardware needs to be replicated

- read and write ports to the registers 
	- 64 bits each so a lot of wires
- stop signal 
- ALU	
	- kinda we need one full ALU 
	- then we need one adder for the pipeline that has access to memory because load and save offsets. 


## In Practice

In theory these changes would allow us to have 2x speed but this relies on that all instructions can be ran together and they do not depend on one another. 

Example code 
```
for ( i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {	
	a[i]++;
}
```

Example code in LEGV8

```
i -> X9
a -> x19
```

```
ADD X9, X20, XZR
top:
SUBIS, XZR, X9, #1000
B EQ end
LSL X10, X19, #3 // X10 = a[i]
ADD X10, X10, X19
LDUR X11, X10, #0 // X11 = a[i]
ADDI X11, X11, #1 
STUR X11, [X10, #0] // a[i]  = a[i] +1
ADDI X9, X9, #1
B top
end:

```

What instructions require what pipeline

|     |          |      |           |       | ALU          | LD / St      |
| --- | -------- | ---- | --------- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1   | ADD      | X9,  | X20,      | XZR   | $\checkmark$ |              |
|     | top:     |      |           |       |              |              |
| 2   | SUBIS,   | XZR, | X9,       | #1000 | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 3   | B EQ end |      |           |       | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 4   | LSL      | X10, | X19,      | #3    | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 5   | ADD      | X10, | X10,      | X19   | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 6   | LDUR     | X11, | X10,      | #0    |              | $\checkmark$ |
| 7   | ADDI     | X11, | X11,      | #1    | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 8   | STUR     | X11, | [X10, #0] |       |              | $\checkmark$ |
| 9   | ADDI     | X9,  | X9,       | #1    | $\checkmark$ |              |
| 10  | B        | top  |           |       | $\checkmark$ |              |
|     | end      |      |           |       | $\checkmark$ |              |


What instructions can be ran together

|     | 1   | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 1   | nop |
| 2   | 2   | nop |
| 3   | 3   | nop |
| 4   | 4   | nop |
| 5   | 5   | nop |
| 6   | 9   | 6   |
| 7   | 7   | nop |
| 8   | 10  | 8   |

By implementing this we reduced the number of instructions by 2


## Implement without loop
```
LDUR X9, [X19, #0]
ADDI X9, X9, #1
STUR X9, [X19, #0]
LDUR X9, 
```
...

This can be done but we have some problems because we still have to issue nop 


## We can do better

```
for ( i = 0; i < 1000; i += 2) {	
	a[i]++;
	
	a[i + 1]++
}
```


```
ADD X9, XZR, XZR
top:
SUBIS XZRm X9, #1000
B.EQ end
LSL X10, X9, #3
ADD X10, X10, X19
LDUR X11, [X10, #0]
ADDI X11, X11, #1
STUR X11, [X10, #0]
LDUR X11, [X10, #8]
ADDI X11, X11, #1
STUR X11, [X10, #8]
ADDI X9, X9, #2
B top
end:
```

We have 9 ALU branch
we have 4 LD/ST

We will still have to issue nop's here. 


How can we get this so that the number of ALU instructions and LD/ST are the same? 


We can continue on the though and increment by 3

this results in 10 and 8

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 9   | 4   |
| 3   | 10  | 6   |
| 4   | 11  | 8   |
| 5   | 12  | 10  |
| 6   | 13  | 12  |

The idea is to find a place that the number of instructions are the same.

Home work number 2 is getting released today. 

Went over that exam number 1 will be sometime soon. About 2 weeks from now.

## Encoding Instructions 
```assembly
ADD X19, X11, X12	Shant
```

X19 -> Rd  5 bits
X11 -> Rn 5 bits
X12 -> Rm 5 bits
shant -> 6 bits 

ADD -> mnemonic 11 bits

```assembly
ADDI x27, x21, #127
```

optcode, immediate, Rn, Rd
10, 12, 5, 5

1001000100, 000001111111, 10101, 11011

| LDUR        | X14       |     | [X11  | \#120] |
| ----------- | --------- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| Opcode      | offset    | op  | Rn    | Rt     |
| 11          | 9         | 2   | 5     | 5      |
| 11111000010 | 001111000 | 00  | 01011 | 01110  |

It mattes where `foo` is in the code

foo is a branch if 14 instructions. It is the 30th instruction in the program

| B       | foo  |
| ------- | ---- |
| oppcode | addr |
| 6       | 26   |
| 000101  | 1110 |


foo is 5 instructions above

| CBZ      | X19                 | foo   |

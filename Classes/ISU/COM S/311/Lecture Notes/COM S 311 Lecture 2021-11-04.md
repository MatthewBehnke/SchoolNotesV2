## Smallest number of base stations that cover all the houses

h: k covered if it is within 4 miles of a base station. 

### [[Greedy Choice Property]]

- Start putting base stations from the w side
- The first base station will be placed 4 miles to the east of the first home 
- the second base station will be placed 4 miles to the east of the first unconnected house (from the west)


### Proof

Only two proof strategies 

using the 


Assume: 
($b_1$ is the location of the first base station )
($b_{k+1}$ base station of k +1th base station in OPT)
($b'_{k+1}$ base station of k +1th base station in GS)
($b_{k+1} \not=  b'_{k+1}$)

- OPT: $b_1, b_2, ..., b_k$ | $b_{k+1}$ $B$
- Greedy  $b_1, b_2, ..., b_k$ | $b'_{k+1}$
- OPT' $b_1, b_2, ..., b_k$ | $b'_{k+1}$ $B$


1. ($b_{k+1} < b'_{k+1}$)
2. $(K+1)th$ base station in GS covers at least as many homes as the (K+1)th base station in OPT

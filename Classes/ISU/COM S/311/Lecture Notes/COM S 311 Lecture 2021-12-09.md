## Overview of the semester  / what will be on the exam

put examples of all this onto my notes card

- [x] [[Runtime Analysis]]
	- [x] Big-O relations 
	- [x] code runtime 
		- [x] loops 
			- (+ , - 1) summation 
			- not (+, - 1) unfold
		- [x] Recurrence solving (D & C)
			- Use recurrence tree 
- [[Data Structures]]s 
	- Heap 
		- Heapify
			- up 
			- down
		- Runtime of common heap functions
	- Hashing 
		- will be very similar to problems that we solved before
- [[Graph Algorithms]]
	- [[Depth First Search]] Exploration 
		- start times 
		- end times 
		- topological ordering 
		- loops
	- [[Breath First Search]]   Exploration 
		- shortest path
			- unweighted 
			- weighted when all weights are the same
			- [[Bipartiteness]] 
	- [[Strongly Connected Components]] // wont need to write but apply
		- Two algorithms that will need to know 
		- Quotient / complement 
			- graph is a  DAG
			- [[Single Source Shortest Path in Weighted DAG]]
- [[Divide and Conquer]]
	- Sorted list of elements 
		- [[Binary Search]]
	- Unsorted list elements
		- splitting / cross elements 
		- example [[Merge Sort]]
		- counting inversions 
- [[Greedy Algorithms]]
	- wont need to write an algorithms but will need to prove that it is correct 
	- Greedy stays ahead 
		- subset finding problem 
	- exchange arg 
		- sequence 
	- [[Graph Algorithms]]
		- [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]] sssp (apply)
			- shortest path 
			- parent relationship 
			- Runtime O((V + E) LOG(V))
		- [[Prim's Algorithm]] mst (apply)
			- parent relationship
- [[Dynamic Programming]]
	- optimization type problem (write the algorithm )
	- how to solve 
		- write the recursive solution 
		- ...
	- subset sum 
		- OPT(i,B) : max sum achievable using elements  
		- 1,2,...,i w/ a budget B
		- = max {
			- v(i) + opt(i -1, B - v(i)) v(i) <= B
			- OPT(i-1 ,B)
		- OPT'(i,B)
			- max sum such using elemts i. i+1. w/ n w/ budget B
	 - [[Bottom-up Completion]]
	 - [[Top-down Completion]]
	- [[Bellman-Ford Algorithm]] SSSP
		- O(VE)
	- DAG SSSP -verts 
		- O(V + E)
		- Done before [[Bellman-Ford Algorithm]]
	- Multiple dicts 
		- max sum subset  
- N / NP
	- NP
		- show that it can be verified 
	- P
		- all problems in p are in NP



- Four types of graph problems

## Theorem 11

The Kolmogorov complexity function C is not computable. In fact, if  $f : \subseteq \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is any computable partial function that is a lower bound for C on its domain (i.e., $f(x) \leq C(x)$ for all $x \in$ domain f), then f is bounded (i.e., there is a constant $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(x) \leq m$ holds for all $x \in$ dom f).

### Proof 

The first sentence clearly follows from the second sentence, because C is a lower bound of itself and is unbounded by Obs 10. 

To prove the second sentence, let $f : \subseteq \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be a computable partial function that is unbounded. It is suffices to show that f is not a lower bound of C. Let $M_f$ be a TM that computes f, and consider the following algorithm. 

```
input n;
for t = 1 to inf do
	simulate M_f(x) for t steps for each
	x in {0,1}^{\leq t}, halting with output x
	if M_f(x) halts with an output \geq n.

```

This is called dogtailing

This algorithm clearly computes a partial function $h : \subseteq \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$. In fact, since f is unbounded h is total, $h : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow {0,1}^*$. Moreover, h has the property that 

$f(h(n)) \geq \mathbb{N}$

for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$

***By Corollary 9***
There is a constant $b_h \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$,

$C(h(n)) \leq log(n + 1) + b_h$. 

It follows that, for all  but finitely many $n \in \mathbb{N}$, 
$C(h(n))  \leq log(n + 1) + b_n < n \leq f(h(n))$.

Hence f is not a lower bound of C  $\blacksquare$.

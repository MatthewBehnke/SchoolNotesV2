## C(x) = the plain Kolmogorov complexity of x

## K(x) = the kolmogrove complexity of x

Developed by [[Levin]] in 73 

The main diff is that we require the set of all programs making a TM produces a value to be a prefix set (no valid program is a prefix of any other valid program).

### Fact 
Developed by [[Levin]] in 73
A sequence $S \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is random if there is a constant $c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

$K(S[0,,n-1]) \geq n -c$


$\underset{\sim}{m}(x)=$ probability that a program algorithm will print x = $\Omega$


## [[Levin]]'s coding theorem 

There is a constant $c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$

$|K(x) - log(\frac{1}{\underset{\sim}{m}(x)})| \leq c$.


## 2000: 
Defined the dimension of a string $x \in \{0,1\}^*$

dim(x)

There is a constant $c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, the following three qualities are within c bits of one another:

[[Kilmogorov]] 65
[[Shannen]] 48
[[Handsdorf]] 19

$K(x) \underset{Levin}{=}  \underset{Shannen}{log \frac{1}{\underset{\sim}{m}(x)} |x|} \underset{Jack\ Lutz}{=} \underset{Handsdorf}{dim(x)}$



## Number Theory 

We now use Kolmogorov complexity to do a bit of number theory 

### Notation 

- $P_0,P_1,P_2$,... is the enumeration of all prime numbers in order. Thus $P_0$ = 2, $P_1$ = 5m etc

- For $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+, \pi (n) = |\{i | P_i \leq n\}|$ is the number of prime numbers $\leq n$.

- Gauss conjectured: $\underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{lim} \frac{\pi (n)}{\frac{n}{ln(n)}} = 1$ Proven $\approx$ 1900. Now called the [[Prime Number Theorem]]

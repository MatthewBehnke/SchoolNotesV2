## Recall

We proved Kraft's inequality $\therefore$ if A $\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is a prefix set, then $\sum\limits_{x \in A}^{}2^{-|x|} \leq 1$

## Kraft's Inequality Proof #2

Choose a sequence S $\in \{0,1\}^\infty$ by independent tosses of a fair coin.  For each x $\in \{0,1\}^*$,
Pr[$x \sqsubseteq s$] = $2^{-|x|}$ 
$\therefore$  1 $\geq$ Pr[$(\exists x \in A) x \sqsubseteq s$] $= \sum\limits_{x \in A}^{}2^{-|x|}$ $\ \blacksquare$

## Finite Automata and Regular Sets

Early objectives: working knowledge of
- state
- discrete time
- state transition
- state space

### Definition a [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]] is a 5-tuple

 M = (Q, $\sum, \delta, s, F$ )

Where
- $Q$ is a finite set of states;
- $\sum$ is an alphabet, called the input alphabet;
- $s \in Q$ is the start(initial) sate;
- $F \subset Q$ is the accepting(final) states;
- $\delta : Q \times \sum \rightarrow Q$ is the transition function;

### Intuition: 
Time is discrete, i.e, that time variable t ranges over the natural numbers.

At time t = 0, the DFA M is in state state s. If M is in state q at time t and M reads a symbol a $\in \sum$ at this time, then M will be in state set $\delta(q,a)$ at time t + 1.

Given an input $x \in \sum^*$, M reads the successive symbols of x at times t = 0, 1,...,|x| - 1, starting in state s at time 0, and ending in some state r at time |x|. If r $\in F$, then M accepts the input x; otherwise, M rejects x.

The set (L(M))of strings accepted by M is a language over $\sum$, i.e, a decision problem. We regard M as a solution of this decision problem. 


L(M) can be an infinant set but each string hast to be finite

### Example problems

#### 1

Let M = ($Q$, $\sum, \delta$,$s$, $F$ )
where Q = {0,1,2,3}, $\sum = \{0,1\}$
F = {3}, and delta is given by the table $\delta$: Q $\times \sum \rightarrow Q$

| $\delta$(q,a) | 0   | 1   |
| ------------- | --- | --- |
| 0             | 0   | 1   |
| 1             | 1   | 2   |
| 2             | 2   | 3   |
| 3             | 3   | 3   |

Question:
What strings does M accept?

A: L(M) = $\{x \in \{0,1\}^* | \#(1,x) \geq 3 \}$

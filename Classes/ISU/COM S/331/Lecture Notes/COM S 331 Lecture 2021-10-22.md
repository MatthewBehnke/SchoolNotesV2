Once you know that the halting problem H is undecidable, you usually prove that other languages A are undecidable by proving that H $\leq_m$ A.

## Recall
We identify each language A $\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ with its characteristic sequence  $X_A \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ : $X_A [n] =\{1\ if\ s_n \in A, 0\ if\ s_n \notin A\} = [[S_n \in A]]$. 

## QA

Let A, B $\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ be languages. 
Q: how to construct a language that has all the information in A and all the information in B. 
A:  $A \sqcup B$ = $\{x0 |\ x \in A\} \cup \{y1 | y \in B\}$ (interleave $X_A, X_B$)


## Four reducibilities

- $\leq_T$ Turing 1938 
	- A $\leq_T B$
- $\leq_m$ Post 1944
- $\leq_T^P$ Cook 1971 (Levin 1973)
- $\leq_m^P$ Karp 1972

## Recall

$A \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is a decidable if there a TM M that accepts every element of A and rejects every element of $\{0,1\}^* -A$ (Hence this M halts on every input!)

## computably enumerable (c.e) 
A language $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is computably enumerable (c.e) if there is a TM M such that L(M) = A, where L(M) is the set of all strings accepted by M. 

A language is $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ is co-computably enumerable (co-ce) if $\{0,1\}^* -A$ is c.e

The classes DEC, CE, and coCE of languages are defined in the now-obvious way.

- $DEC \subseteq CE$
- $H \in CE - DEC$
- $coDEC = DEC$
- $c \subseteq D \Rightarrow coC \subseteq  coD$
- $DEC  \subseteq coCE$ 

## The  Landscape

Claim: $CE \cap coCE = DEC$

$A \in CE \cap coCE$
$A = L(M_1)$
$\{0,1\}^* - A = L(M_2)$


## In Many ways 

$\frac{P}{NP} = \frac{DEC}{CE}$


## Believes:
$P \not= NP$
$P \not= NP \cap coNP$

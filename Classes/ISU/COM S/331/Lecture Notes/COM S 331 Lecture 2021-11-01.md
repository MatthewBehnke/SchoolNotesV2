## What is a computable real number? 

- (Turing 36)  x $\in \mathbb{R}$ is computable if the function f: $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ defined by $f(n) =$the nth bit of $x-\lfloor x \rfloor$ is computable
- (modern version of Turing 37) $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is computable if there exists a computable function $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Q}$ such that, for all $r \in \mathbb{N}$, $|f(r) - x| \leq 2^{-r}$.


## Algorithmic Information Theory

We have a box that contains a TM called M. The box has an input called $\pi$ that is the description. Then the output of the box is x which is the data.  ...  $\pi, x \in \{0,1\}^*$

### Def: PLain Kolmogorov Complexity

Let M be a TM and $x \in \{0,1\}^*$. The Kolmogorov Complexity (K-complexity) of x with respect to M is $C_M (x) = min\{\ |\pi| \ |\ \pi \in \{0,1\}^*\ \text{and}\ M(\pi) = x\}$ where min $\emptyset = \infty$.

Intuition: $\pi$ is the description of, or program for x in the "Language of M" $C_M(x)$ is the information content of x with respect to the algorithm M.

### Def: 

A TM $u$ is optimal if, for every TM  M, there is a constant $C_M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, fir all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $C_u(x) \leq C_M(x) + c_M$ (*)

### Theorem 1

(optionalilty theorem - solomonov 1964, Kolmogrov 1965 chaitin 1969) 

Every universal TM is optional.

##### Proof 
Let u be a universal TM. To  see that u is optimal, let m be a TM. Let $c_M$ = 2|#(m)| +1 
To see that $c_M$ has the desired property, let $x \in \{0,1\}^*$. 
If $C_M(x) = \infty$ then (*) is clear, so assume that $C_M(x) < \infty$. Then there is a program $\pi \in \{0,1}^*$ such that. 

M($\pi$) = x (A)
$|\pi| = C_M(x)$ (B)

u is universal, so 

$u(<\#(M), \pi>) = M(\pi)$

$|<\#(M), \pi>|$ = $2|\#(M)| + |\pi| + 1$

Let $\pi'$ = $<\#(M, \pi)>$. Then $u(\pi') = M(\pi)=X$, so $C_u(x) \leq |\pi'|$ = $|\pi| + c_M$ = $C_M(x) + c_M \blacksquare$

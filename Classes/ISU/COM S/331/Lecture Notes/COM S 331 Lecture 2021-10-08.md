## Turing Machines

This is the can opener that can open any can that can be opened by can openers (BBC Commercial).

There is a tape that is $\infty$ long

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


| M   |
| --- |
M is a finite-state control that is a read / write head that can move to any other place in the tape.


- $\sum$: input alphabet
- $\Gamma$ tape alphabet
- $\sum \cup \{\}$
- ***s ***:  start state
- ***t***:  accept state (halting)
- ***r***: reject state (halting)

### Def 
A Turing machine (TM) is a 9-tuple M=($Q, \sum, \Gamma, ..., ..., \delta, s, t, r$)

Where 

Q is a finite set of states;
$\sum$ is the input alphabet;
$\Gamma$ is the tape alphabet;
$...$ is the left end marker;
$...$ is the blank symbol;
s is the start state;
t is the accept state;
r is the reject state;

$\delta$: Q $\times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$ is the transition function.


### We further stipulate the following.

$\sum \cup \{...(L marker), ...(blank marker)\} \subseteq \Gamma$;

no transition changes ...(L marker);

For all $a \in \Gamma$, $\delta (t,a)$ = $(t,a,r)$
$\delta(r,a) = (r,a,R)$.

## Example Design a TM that decides $\{0^n 1^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$.

Idea:  start with an input 

In the language 

| (left) | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Not in the language 

| (left) | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| (left) | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Lets try: 
- scan to the right, rejecting if input not of form 0^* 1^*, and mark right end with (end symbol); 
- scan left, erasing first 0 and first 1; 
- repeat until obvious.

s = scanning right
s0 = "      " seen 0
s1 = "      "     " 1
l = scan left
el0 = " " erased 0 
el1 = " " erased 1

| $\delta(q,a)$ | (left)       | 0              | 1             | (blank)        | (right) |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| s             | s, (left), R | s0, 0, R       | r, -, -       | t, -, -        | -,-,-   |
| s0            | -,-,-        | s0,0,R         | s1,1,R        | r,-,-          | -,-,-   |
| s1            | -,-,-        | r,-,-          | s1,1,R        | l,(right), L   | -,-,-   |
| l             | -,-,-        | r,-,-          | el1,(blank),L | l,(blank), L   | -,-,-   |
| el1           | r,-,-        | el0,(blank), L | el1,1,L       | el1,(blank), L | -,-,-   |
| el0           | -,-,-        |                |               |                |         |

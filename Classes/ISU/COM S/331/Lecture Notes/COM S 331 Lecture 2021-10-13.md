## Five methods for proving a language A is not regular

- Brute Force: find the quivelent x,y that DFA must confuse.
- Myhill-Nerode: 
- Pumping Lemma:
- Kolmgrov Complexity:
- Ordinal Extensions:


### Principle behind 1,2

1 and 2 always work, with extra ah hoc cleverness.

### 3,4,5

these are systematic, and usually work. 

5 are short easy proofs.
4 gives proofs that are intuitive because they talk about information but not as short as 5 but much shorter than 3.
3 is a warm up for the pumping lemma for context free languages. 

### Next steps : Find extensions of 4 and 5 to CFLs (or maybe DCFLs at first).


## Turing Machines

### Back to a TM that is "universal for DFAs"

$(\forall DFA\ M)(\exists\ TM\ M^*)M^*\ simulates\ M$

d $(\exists\ {TM}\ M^{**})(\forall\ DFA\ M)\ M^{**}\ simulats\ M$

$M^{**}$ get an encoding of M followed by an input x on its tape. Restricting attention to $\sum = \{0,1\}$. Then the input is a binary string that we can encode onto the string. 

This is the universal TM for all DFAS but the same idea can be applied to create the universal TM for all TM. 

w is a bitmap of F
$\#(M) = 0^n 1 w \#\delta$, where 

$\# \delta =$ table of Zn entries (states)
$= \#\delta(1,0)\#\delta(1,1)\#\delta(2,0)\#\delta(2,1),...,\#\delta(n,1)$
where 
$\# q = 0^0 1$

Designing $M^{**}$ is designing a fetch-execute cycle.

## History of TCS

### 1847 to 1922: Mathematical
Formulation of mathematical logic. 
Boole, Frege, Peano, Russell, Whitehead, Zermelos, Frankel, HIlbert, von Neumann.

Peano Arithmetic 
$\rightarrow$ Prinicipia Mathematica
Zermelo-Fraenke set Theory 


Russell's Paradox:

x = $\{s | s \notin s\}$

### 1928: Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem)

### 1929: Godel's Completeness Theorem

### 1931: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

- In any theory strong enough to do arithmetic, there are true statements that are not provable. (veratasium) ("I am not provable")
- No such theory can prove its own consistency.
	$\therefore$ Obvious approach to Entscheidungsproblem wont work.
	
### 1932-1935: Alonzo Church "$\lambda$-calculus" as foundation of mathematics

### 1935: Kleene & Rosser
Showed that no such foundation is consistent

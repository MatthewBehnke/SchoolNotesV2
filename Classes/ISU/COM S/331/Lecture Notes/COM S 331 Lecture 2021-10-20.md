## From now on

$\overset{\sim}{=}$ Means: Either bits sides are undefined (run forever) or both sides are defined and equal (output and acc/rej) (The Kleene equality)

<u,v> = $0^{|u|}1uv$

- All TMs have input alphabet $\sum = \{0,1\}$
- We fix an encoding function 
	- #:{TMs}$\overset{1-1}{\rightarrow}$ $\{0,1\}^*$
	- Also a  TM u with the following two properties
		1. The language CODES = $\{\#(M) |\text{M is a TM}\}$ is decidable
		2. The TM u is universal in the sense that, for every TM M and every input $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ for M, u(<#(m, x)>) $\overset{\sim}{=}$ M(x).
- By (1) we can we can write CODES = {$u_0, u_1, u_2,...$}, where each $u_i$ precedes $u_i$ in the std enum of $\{0,1\}^*$
- Def: for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$, the $i^{th}$ Tm is the TM $M_i$ such that 
	- TM $M_i$ such that 
		- $\#(M_i) = u_i$
	- Then
		- $M_0, M_1, M_2, ...$ ( This contains every algo)
	- is the std enum of all TM's. 
- Note that a minor  variant of u, call it $\hat{u}$ for the moment, has the property that, for all  $i \in \mathbb{N}$ and $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $\hat{u}(<i,x>)\overset{\sim}{=}M_i (x)$
- Notation: $\phi_i\ i \subseteq \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$ is the partial function computed by $M_i$.
	- Then
		- $\phi_0,\phi_1,\phi_2, ...$
		- is the std enum of all computable partial functions 
		- On one day: $\phi_i \ i \subseteq \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$
		- On another: $\phi_i i \subseteq \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
- Notation: 
	- $M(X)\downarrow  :$ M halts on input x
	- $M(X)\uparrow  :$ M does not halt on input x
- Def: 
	- The rapidly growing functions
		- G : $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
	- is defined by
		- $G(n) = 1 + max \{ \phi_k (l) |\ 0 \leq k \leq n,\ 0 \leq l \leq n,\ \phi_k (l) \downarrow\}$
		- Note: max $\emptyset$ = 0


- Obs
	1.  G is total, i,e, G(n) is defined for all n.
	2.  G is non-decreasing, i.e., G(n) $\leq$ G(n +1)  for all n
- Def: the halting problem is the set $H = \{(k,l) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}|\ M_k(l)\downarrow\}$.
- Obs 3:  If H is decidable, then G is computable.  
- Lemma 4: G grows faster then any computable function. That is: every computable function f: $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ we have G(n) > f(n) for all but finitely many n. 	
	- Correctness: 	G is not computable.
	- Theorem 6 (Turing 1936): H is undecidable.
	- Proof of Lemma 4: 
		- Let $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be computable. 
		- Then there is an index i $\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\phi_i = f$
		- Then, for all $n \geq i$, 
			-  $G(n) = 1 + max \{ \phi_k (l) |\ 0 \leq k \leq n,\ 0 \leq l \leq n,\ \phi_k (l) \downarrow\}$
			-  $\geq 1 + \phi_i(n)$
			-  $>\phi_i (n)$
			-  = f(n). $\blacksquare$

# COM S 331 Lecture 2021-10-06

## Exam 1

Covers material from HW 1 to HW 5

Should be a take home.

## History Cont'd

### 1932 - 1935 
Church develops $\lambda$-calculus, intended as a foundation of mathematics. 
Kleene and Rosser proved that any such foundation is inconsistent.
### 1936
Church salvage operation: proposed that a function f:$\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is algorithmicaly computable if and only if it is $\lambda$-definable.
Other logicians, especially Godel, rejected this.
Church proves that $\lambda$-definable $\equiv$ Godel-Herbrand recursive.

--- 
Turning starts grade school.
Takes a logic course from MHA Newman
Learns about Hilbert's E--- problem 
Turing decides to prove that it is unsolvable.
Turing creates the a-machine 
Turing publishes his paper about a-machines 

Introduces the o-machine (during his PHD)

### Church-Turing Thesis:
A function is computable if and only if there is a Turing machine that computes it.

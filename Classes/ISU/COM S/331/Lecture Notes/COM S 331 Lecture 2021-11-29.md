## What is a random sequence

Borel 1909: A sequence $S \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is normal if, for every string $w \in \{0,1\}^+$, the asymptotic frequency of w in S is $2^{-|w|}$. That is $freq(w,s) = \underset{n \rightarrow \infty}{lim} \frac{[\{k | 0 \leq k \leq n \ and \ S[K|w| --(k+1)|w| - 1]\}]}{n}$  = $2^{-|w|}$

Borel: If you choose $S \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ unif at random, the Pr[S is normal] = 1

A real number $\alpha$ is normal base 2 if the binary expansion of $\alpha - \lfloor \alpha \rfloor$ is normal. A real number is normal base b if ....

A real number is absolutely normal if it is normal in every base $b \geq 2$

### Conjectures:

$\pi$ is absolutely normal 
$\sqrt{2}$ ...
$ln2$ ....

There are no known "natural" examples of real numbers that are normal in any base.

Champernoune: The following number is normal base 2

$base _2$ 0.0100011011000001010...
$base_{10}$ 0.1234567891011121314...

(Analytic number theory)

Schnorr and Stimm $\approx$ 1972 : A sequence $S \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is normal if and only if no finite state gambler can make unbounded money placing fair bets on it. 

$\therefore$ Normality is finite state randomness. 

### Martin-Lof 1966

Defined randomness of sequences convincingly, combining probability with computability 

A sequence $s \in \{0,1\}^\infty$ is random if $\{S\}$ does mot have "c.e. probability" 0

Schorr, just before Schnorr and Stimm 

 A sequence s is random if and only if no lower semicompputable  betting strategy can make wnbdd ## betting on it.

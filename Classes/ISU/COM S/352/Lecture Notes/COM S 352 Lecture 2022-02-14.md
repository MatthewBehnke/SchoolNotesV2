### TLB 

Page table is stored in main memory 

Every memory access requires additional read to look up page table entry - unacceptable overhead 

MMU hardware called Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) solution

### TLB is a Cache of Page Table Entries 

### TLB Cache 

On each memory access
- Look for VPN in TLB cache 
- if found (TLB hit) 
- Else (TLB miss) get entry from page table in main memory 
- Store entry in cache 

### Why does Cache Work

if memory access is random then cache is useless

Spartial [[Locality]] - Address of memory access is likely to be close to the previous access

Temporal locality - address likely to repeat in time 

### Sequential memory

memory access is common and programs read sequential access from memory 


### Hardware vs Software 

The TLB cache lookup must be in hardware

Handle the miss in software 

### Replacement Policy

Least recently used (LRU) replace the entry that was used the longest ago 

Random - replace an entry at random 

### Context Switches 

Each process has its own page

What happens to the TLB cache on context switch 
	 Flush the cache

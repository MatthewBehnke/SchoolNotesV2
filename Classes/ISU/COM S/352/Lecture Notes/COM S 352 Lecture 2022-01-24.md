# [[COM S 352]] Lecture [[2022-01-24]]

Went back over fork and wait commands and their 

### Slides Cont from last lecture

### exec() // Change the Program  

``` init exec(const char *pathname, char *const argv[])```

- Replaces the current program with a new one 
- Command line arguments are passed in argv
- The Process keeps it file descriptors 
- On success:
	- The process is running a new program
	- The function does not return (no where to return)
- On failure 
	- The function returns -1 

	
### Inter-process Communication 

- A pipe is a unidirectional data channel that can be used to communicate from one process to another 
	- Sender puts data to one end (the write end of the pipe )
	- Receiver gets data other the other end (the read-end of the pipe)
-  Common example is the shell, it creates two children and pipes standard (e.g., printf) of one into standard in (e.g. read) of other 

### pipe() // Connect two processes 

```int pipe(int p[2]);```

- Creates communication channel 
- Typical usage is right before calling fork, each process must close the ends of the pipe it is not using 
- On success:
	- p[0] is file descriptor of read side of pipe, 
	- p[1] is write side of pipe 
	- returns 0
- On failure 
	- returns -1 

### dup() // Duplicate file descriptor

```int dup(int fd);```

- Returns new file descriptor that is the lowest numbered available descriptor
- New file descriptor refers to the same source as fd did previously 
- For example, closing standard out (1) and than calling dup(fd) will cause all calls to printf to be directed to what fd pointed to 
- On success 
	- New file descriptor points to source of provided file descriptor
	- Returns new file descriptor 
- On failure 
	- Returns -1 

## Today's Notes 

### Limited Direct Execution 

- Time sharing is the idea that multiple processes can run together on a single machine as though they  are in sole control of the machine 
- How to processes share time? 
	- Multi-programming
		- When a process waits for I/O, the OS can have another take over the CPU
	- multitasking 
		- each process gets a time slice, a time limit before the next process gets to execute on the CPU 
- How does the OS keep control 
	- Hardware provides interrupts, kernel mode, and user mode

  ### Direct Execution 

  - OS (1)
	  - Create entry for process
	  - Allocate memory for program
	  - Load program into memory
	  - Set up stack 
	  - clear registers
	  - call main()
  - Program
	  - run main()
	  - execute return from main
  - OS(2)
	  - Free memory of process
	  - ...

### Restricting Access with Processor Mode

- CPU has bit that indicates if in user mode. or kernel mode 
- When in user mode, "privileged" instructions not allowed and memory boundaries are enforced 
	- Cannot read/ write outside of address space bounds 
	- Cannot read/write I/O devices
- When in kernel mode, all instructions are allowed 
- Normal processes only execute in user mode and kernel in kernel mode

### Processor mode 

- OS  Kernel Mode(1)
	- Create entry for process
	- Allocate memory for program
	- Load program into memory
	- Set up stack 
	- clear registers
	- call main()
-  Program User Mode
	- Run main(0
	- execute return from main
- OS Kernel Mode (2)
	- Free memory from process 

### System Call

- A system call is different from a normal function call in that it transfers control to the OS 
- A program initiates a system call by causing a trap (software generated interrupt)


### System Call Example 

Library functions like printf typically have some code that executes in user mode, it then makes one or more system calls.

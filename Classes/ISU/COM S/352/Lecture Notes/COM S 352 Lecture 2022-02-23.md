### Clock Algorithm

LRU preforms the closest in optimal for typical workloads, but it is really costly on every memory access 

Clock Algorithm - is a way to approximate LRU cheeply

Add extra use bit to page table entry, on every memory access MMU set use bit of page to 1


### Dirty Bit Optimization 

If a age has only been read from there is no reason to write it back to the swap space when it is evicted 


Add a dirty but to the page table, init to 0 then on every write to the MMU set the bit to 1

Also can make the clock Algo make efficient 
	Find the first clean page first before going to dirty pages 

### Concurrency 

We have explored how OSes use concurrency 
- Multi-programming - to utilize the CPU efficiently when programs block for I
- multitasking - to give all programs a fair slice of the CPU and make progress


Within a process  we can use threads for concurrent points of execution 

### Thread Control Block (TCB)

Very similar to the Process Control Block (PCB)

### Concurrency VS Parallelism

Concurrent means multiple threads making progress in time but may be implemented by time-sharing, can be in one or more CPU cores 

Parallel means multiple threads instructions executing independently on multiple CPU cores

### Memory Virtualization

We want to ive users an easy view of memory, but the reality is must more messy

- Memory can become framented
- Unused address space doesn't need to be mapped to physical memory 
- Not every process will fit into memory 

### GB vs GiB

### Word Size

Processor architecture determines word size 

Registers, instructions, address bus and data bus are typically one word 


### Flags 

Flags are a single bit to represent a boolean Value 

bitwize 

### Masking 

- Making is used to reveal any number of specific bits 


### Bit Packing

Compression algorithms are device drivers deal with bit's one at a time 



### Address Translation 

Memory virtualization 

Address Translation 

Hardware based address translation 


### Software Based Translation Method 

The purpose of a loader is  to load the binary program on disk into the process memory 

Some early loaders also had the job of translating all addresses found in instruction from virtual to physical locations 

Translation is performed once (statically) before the process begins execution 

### Base and Bounds Translation Method 

The base and bounds method requires two CPU registers 
- Base - points to start of process in physical memory 
- Bounds - points to maximum legal address for process  

Allows dynamic relocation or process memory

### MMU 

The hardware responsible is the Memory Management Unit 

it is typically part of the CPU but sits between the core and the address buss 

Translates all addresses between CPU and main memory

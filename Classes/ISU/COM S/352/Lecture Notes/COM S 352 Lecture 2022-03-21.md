### The Four Conditions for Deadlock 

- All four conditions must hold for deadlock to be possible 
	- Mutual Exclusion:
	  threads claim exclusive control of resources that they require 
	- Hold-and -wait:
	  Threads hold resources allocated to them while waiting for additional resources 
	- No preemption:
	  Resources cannot be forcefully removed from threads that are holding them 
	- Circular wait:
	  There exists a circular chain of threads such that each thread holds one or more resources that are being requested by the next thread by the next thread in the chain

### Removing Mutual Exclusion 

One solution to the deadlock example would be to remove the need for mutual exclusion 

### Adding Preemption 

What if a thread can have its resources preempted? Then the deadlock would be broken 

If not careful, preemption can lead to a race condition, one strategy is restart the thread or process

Another alternative is a trylock - try to get the lock but don't block 

### Preventing Circular Wait 

On strategy to prevent circular wait is to enforce a total ordering of locks 

### Deadlock Avoidance and Detect and Recover 

Preventing deadlocks is a difficult problem, there is no really good general solution 

Alternatives to preventing deadlocks 
- Avoid deadlocks by modifying the scheduler, a cleaver scheduler might know that two threads should never be scheduled concurrently because it can result in hold and wait 
- Detect and recover from a  deadlock, some deadlocks are so difficult to prevent or avoid that OSes use the fallback strategy of detect the deadlock are reboot the system when it happens.

## I/O Devices 
Computers are not much use without input and output 

I/O is a lot slower than the CPU and out goal is to keep the CPU busy 

multi programming is one way to achieve this

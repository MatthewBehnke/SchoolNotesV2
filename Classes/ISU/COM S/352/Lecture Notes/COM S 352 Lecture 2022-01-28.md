### Policy: Shortest Time to Completion First (STCF)

Implementation: Priority queue sorted by time to completion ( Shortest first)


### Problem with STCF

Preemption gives STCF better response time in some cases, but there are still cases where response time can be poor

### Policy: Round Robin (RR)

Implementation: FIFI queue
Preemption: Job on CPU gets time-slice, preempt when time expired 
Advantage Low responce time 

### Pro and Con of RR

Pro: we have great response time with a guaranteed upper bound 
Con:
- Bad average turnaround time 
- Frequent context switches reduces CPU efficiency 

### Another Problem with SJF and STCF: Oracle 

Scheduler does not know how long it will take for a job to complete 

SJF and STCF require an oracle, the ability to see into the future 

Benefits of TCF in a real system 


### Multi Level Feedback Queue 

SJf and STCF have good features, but they require an oracle vision and have serious flaws 

### Multi Level Queue 

High to low priority queues with each level being a round robin queue 



### CPU bound vs I/O bound 

Jobs that need fast response but little CPU time gets highest priority
Jobs that need long CPU time are little I/O should be the lowest 


### Problems 

We cant ask what type of process it is 

### Adding Feedback to Multilevel Queue 

- When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest priority 
- If a job uses up an entire time slot while running, it;s priority is reduced 
- if a job gives up the CUP before the time slice is up it stays at the same priority level.

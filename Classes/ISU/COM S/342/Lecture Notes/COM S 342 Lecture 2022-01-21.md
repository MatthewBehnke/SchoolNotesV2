## Designing a programming language

- Computation: to actually compute, e.g. primitive expressions, addition, subtraction 
- Composition: to put together computation e.g. sequential (order), choice 
- Abstraction: to make programming scalable, e.g. function, name, that can be repeatedly used to refer to a complex piece of computation. 

### Designing a programming language: a tool for communication 

- Syntax for validity: is this syntacitically valid 
- Semantics for understanding: what does this sentence mean

### How to specify a language 

Language users, designers, implementer's may not be able to talk to each other so a written formal specification is needed 
- English prose and examples in a careful, expository document 
- compiler / interpreter implementation 
- Formal, mathematical tools, grammar, semantics 

### Mathematical aspects of programming languages 
- context free grammars
- operational semantics 
- lambda calculus 

### Review and the key taken away

- What is a programming language 
- programming paradigms 

## Lecture 2 

### What is a grammar 
- informal grammar - English 
- formal grammar
	- What are the atoms 
		- lexeme: int, a, -, 0
		- tokens: terminal + link to the symbol table for implementing
		- terminals (given in the grammar) identifier, numbers 
	- how to compose them to form s sentence 
	- others e.g regular expressions 

- A program is syntactically correct if it follows the grammar of the language in which it is written

### Grammar: different aspects 
- A language is the set of strings 
- Rules to define strings in the language 


### Connection to [[Chomsky Hierarchy]] 

Language type are determined by their grammars; the grammar types are determined by the patters of their production rules 

- Type (0): [[Recursively enumerable]]  ([[Turing machine]])
- Type (1):  [[Context sensitive]] ([[linear bounded non-deterministic Turing machine]])
- Type (2): [[Context free]]  ([[non deterministic pushdown automaton]])
- Type (3): Regular ([[finite state automaton]])


### [[Context Free Grammar]] (CFG)

A CFG is a tuple G = ($\sum$, V,S,P) where 
- $\sum$ is a set of terminals 
- V is a set of non terminals such that $\sum \cap V$ = $\emptyset$
- $S \in V$ is a start non terminal 
- P is a set of product rules, each of the form: $X -> w$ such that $X \in V$ and $w \in (\sum \cup V)^*$ 

### Notations for Production Rules 

- Left to right 
- If not specified, assume LHS of first production is the start symbol 
- Productions with the same LHS are combined with | 
- ....

### Generating strings from grammar

Rewriting / deriviation apply a sequence of production rules starting at the start symbol, each application is called a rewrite 

Given grammar rules $S \rightarrow 0S | 1S |\epsilon$, generating a string 011 from G

$S \Rightarrow 0S$
$\Rightarrow 01S$
$\Rightarrow 011S$
$\Rightarrow 011$

is $\epsilon$ a terminal: (no its a string)

### Derivation Notations
- $\Rightarrow$ one step
- $\Rightarrow^+$ one or more steps 
- $\Rightarrow^*$ zero or more steps 

In homework give step by step

## Outline 

### What is a programming language 

- informal 
	- A language to write programs with; programs are sentences and paragraphs written in the language 
	- syntax: defining words and rules for composing words 
	- semantics: defining the meaning of the words; in computation, the meaning is the value that the words compute 
	- how to design such a language: design decisions and trade offs  
	- how to specify such a language (syntax and semantics): for precise communication and automating the implementation 
	- How to design a software to automatically interpret / compile the programs written in this language to generate output 
- More formally
	- A language that expresses computations 
	- A language in which developers write code 

### Programming languages vs. natural language 

- both have syntax and grammar 
- natural language can be ambiguous, but programming languages can not 
- There is naturalness in programs 

### History of programming languages 

- 1950's FORTRAN, LIS, COBOL
- 1970's PASCAL, C
- 1980's C++, 
- 1990's Python, Java
- 2000's Go

### Types of programming languages 

- General purpose language 
- Domain specific language 
	- Light weight 
	- Examples:
		-  SQL 
-  Assembly Languages
-  High Level Languages

### Programming paradigms, programming styles 
- Imperative:
	- Fortran
	- Pascal
	- C
- Object oriented 
	- C++
	- Java
- Functional 
	- Haskel 
	- Lisp
	- R
- Logic 
	- Prolog 

### Imperative Programming

- Easier to learn 
- Better development environments 
- typically faster
- hard to reason modularly
- hard to parallel

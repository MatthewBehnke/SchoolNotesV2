### 

- L(G) is the language defined by grammar G:
	- L(G) = $\{s \in \sum^* | S \Rightarrow^+ s\}$
	- S is the start symbol of the grammar 
	- $\sum$ is the set of terminals for that grammar 
- L(G) contains all strings that can be deviations from the start symbol via one or more derivations 

### leftmost and Right most derivations

- Leftmost derivation: At each derivation point, the left more non-terminal is expanded 
- right most derivation: at each derivation point, the rightmost non-terminal is expanded


### Parsing 

- Parsing: discovering the derivation and constructing a tree (called a parsing tree) based on the derivation
- a parse tree 

### parse Tree

- A parse tree results from the derivation sequences 
	- A terminal is a leaf node
	- each node in the tree is either a terminal or a non-terminal in the production rule 
	- each edge in the tree from a non-terminal results from the application of production on the non-terminal 
	- Application of production rule always results in new nodes in the tree

### Constructing parse trees 

Grammar: E $\rightarrow$ a | b | c | d | E + E | E - E | E * E | (E)

- a 
	- E
	- a
- a * c
	- E
	- E, *, E
	- a, , c 
- c*(b + d)
	- E
	- E, *, E
	- c, , (, E, )
	- , , , , E , +, E
	- , , , , b , , d

### Computing Values Using Parse Tree: Evaluating Semantics 

- Start from the lead nodes to create the operand and find their meaning 

### Ambiguity 

- A grammar is ambiguous if there exists a string that has at least two distinct parse trees 

### Remove Ambiguity 

- Add delimiters: modify grammars and add terminals of deliminator

- Add operator precedence and associativity: (1) modify grammars 


### Give Operator Precedence 

- If more than one operator is present in the expression, the precedence order decides the order in which the operators should be applied 
- Modify grammar: add non-terminals for each precedence level, push the higher levels towards the bottom of the parse trees

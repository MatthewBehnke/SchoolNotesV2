topic: Music 
Good eye contact 
decent body movements
good reason why he can talk about music 
good thesis
good preview (very clear)

How is music being underfunded
increase in enrollment 
decrease in enrollment in music and humanities
hard to support 
does not fall under a area 	
admin unable to control music 

Solution 
not able to just wait for admin to fund music 
need to prove that music needs to be funded 
support music 
	go to concerts 
	by music 
decent citations but did not give full citation 

Music within a community 
attend fundraisers 
merch
attend concerts

College should be more affordable 

Should match inflation rates but is much higher

Argue that tuition is only increasing to keep up campuses but not entirely true 

what needs to happen 
gov increase taxes to pay for higher education 
then 
people would have less debt 
more people would have higher education 

Gov owes it to their country

Idea worth 

Chinese Intellectual Property Theft 
Standing off to the side
reading a lot from the note cards 
long pauses 
not much hand movements

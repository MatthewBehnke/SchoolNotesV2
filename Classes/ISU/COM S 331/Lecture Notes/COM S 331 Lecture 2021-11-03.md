## Recall The Optimality Theorem

Every universal TM is optimal. That is u is a UTM, then for every TM M, there is a constant  $C_M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that , for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $C_u(x) \leq C_M (x) + c_M$.  

***From now on we fix an optimal TM u and omit t from the notation, defining the Kolmogrove complexity, for algorithmic information content, of a string  $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ to be $C(x)= C_u(x)$***

## Theorem (optimality theorem restated)

For every TM M, there is an optimality constant $c_M \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ , $C(x) \leq C_M(x) + c_M$.


## Theorem 

There is a constant $a \in \mathbb{N}$ such that, for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$. $C(x) \leq |x| + a$

### Proof using the optimality theorem 

Let M be a TM that, on input $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, prints x and halts. 
Let $a = c_M$ be an optimality constant for M.

To see that a has the desired property, let $x \in \{0,1\}^*$. Then $M(x) = x$, 

so $C(X) \overset{opt}{\leq}$ $C_M(x) + c_M$
= $C_M(x) + a$
= $|x| + a. \blacksquare$


## Corollary 4

For all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $C(x) < \infty$.

## Theorem (most data is incompressible  )

Let $n,r \in \mathbb{N}$. If we choose $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ uniformly at random, then the Probability $[C(x) \geq n -r] > 1-2^{-r}$. 

### Proof

Assume the hypothesis. Then 

Probability $[C(x) < n - r]$
= $2^{-n}$ | $\{x \in \{0,1\}^* | C(x) < n -r\}$ |
$\leq$ $2^{-n}$ | $\{x \in \{0,1\}^* | C(x) < n -r\}$|

Takes Thought! (more than once) 

$\leq 2^{-n} |\ \{0,1\}^{< n -r}|$

$= 2^{-n} \times(2^{n-r} -1)$

$< 2^{-n} \times 2^{n-r}$

$= 2^{-r}$

proving the theorem $\blacksquare$


summarizing Theorems 3,5: 

(The lossless of data compression )

The Kolnogrove complexity of x is never much more than, and seldom much less that, |x|. 


## Corollary 6

For every $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that $C(x) \geq n$.

### Proof. 

Take $r = 0$ in theorem 5 $\blacksquare$

$prob > 1 - 2^{-0} > 0$
$C(x) \approx n$

## new stuff

To define the semantics (a.k.a, meaning) of [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]] M = (Q, $\sum, \delta$, s, F), We first define the extended transition function:
$\hat{\delta}$ : Q $\times \sum^* \rightarrow Q$
$\delta$ : Q $\times \sum \rightarrow Q$

Intuitively, if q is a state and x is a string, then x is a path from q to $\hat\delta$(q, x) in the state space of M.

Formally, $\hat\delta$ is defined recursively as follows : 
- $\hat\delta(q, \lambda)$ = q
- For x $\in \sum^*$ and $a \in \sum$, $\hat\delta(q, xa)$ = $\delta$($\hat\delta$(q,x),a)


## Def

Let M  = (Q, $\sum, \delta$, s, F) be A DFA, and let $x \in \sum^*$

1. M accepts x if $\hat\delta(s, x) \in F$
2. M rejects x if $\hat\delta(s,x) \not\in F$

We write 

L(M) = $\{x \in \sum^* | \text{M accepts x}\}$

for the language decided (accepted) by M. 

## Def

A language A $\subseteq \sum^*$ is regular, and we write $A \in REG$, if there is a [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]] such that L(M) = A

Example we showed that 
{$s \in \{0,1\}^*| \#(1,x) \geq 3$}
is regular. 

## Example
Recall that, for x $\in${0,1$\}^*$ , we defined bnum(x) to be the natural number that x represents in binary.

Let A = $\{x \in \{0,1\}^* |\ \frac{3}{bnum(x)}$}

## Def. 
for a, b, $\in \mathbb{Z}$ with a $\not=$ 0. that statement

$\frac{a}{b}$ 

means that there exists c $\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that 

ac = b.


Claim: A is regular

### Proof


States:

|       | 0     | 1      |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| 3k    | 3k    | 3k +1  |
| 3k +1 | 3k +2 | 3k     |
| 3k +2 | 3k +1 | 3k + 2 |

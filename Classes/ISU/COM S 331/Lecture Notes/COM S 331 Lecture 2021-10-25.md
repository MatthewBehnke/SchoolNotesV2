## Recall A language A $\subseteq \{0,1\}^* is computobly enumerable 

(c.e.) and we write A $\in$ CE, if there is a TM M such that L(M) = A


## Fact 
for every language A $\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$, the following three conditions are equivalent. 

1.) A is c.e

2.) There is a decidable language B $\subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ such that, for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, x $\in A \Leftrightarrow (\exists w \in \{0,1\}^*) <x,w> \in B$. ("$A = \exists B$")

3.) There  is a c.e. language $B \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ such that, for all $x \in \{0,1\}^*$,  $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, x $\in A \Leftrightarrow (\exists w \in \{0,1\}^*) <x,w> \in B$.

4.) 

### Examples

 - (K,l) $\in$ H $\Leftrightarrow$ ($\exists t$) $M_k (l)$ halts in $\leq t$ steps

- Let a be all the (encodings of) theorems porable in PA ( or ZFC), and let B be the set of all points (x,w) such that $x \in A$ and w encodes a proof of x.

## Complexity theory digression

P is the set of all languages A that are decidable by TMs that can in a number of steps bounded by a polynomial function (k + |x|^k)  of the lengths of their inputs. 

Fact NP is the set of all languages A for which there exists a language $B\ in P$ and a polynomial q such that, for all $x \in A$,
$X \in A  \Leftrightarrow (\exists w \in \{0,1\}^{q(|x|)})<x,w> \in B$. ( A = $\exists^q B$)


Digression 

## Fact:
CE is closed (downward) under $\leq_m$, meaning that $A \leq_m B \in CE \Rightarrow A \in CE$


### Proof

Assume the hypothesis, and let f be a $\leq_m -$ reduction of A to B. Choose a TM $M_B$ such the L($M_B$) = B. Then the TM

drawing of $M_A$


satisfies L($M_A$) = A. $\blacksquare$

For the same proof: DEC, coCE are closed under $\leq_m$


## Def.
Languages $A, B \in \{0,1\}^*$ are $\leq_m -$ Equivalent, and we write $A \equiv_m B$, if $A \leq_m B$ and $B \leq_m A$. equivalence classes of $\equiv_m$ are called $\equiv_m -$ degres  

## Def
Let $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^*$ be a language, and let $\mathbb{C}$ be a class of languages 
1. A is $\leq_m$-hand  for C if, for every $B \in C$, $B \leq_m A$
2. A is $\leq_m$-complete for C if $A \in C$ and A is $\leq_m-hand$ for C.

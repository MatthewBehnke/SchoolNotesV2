## Impossibility Proofs

proofs of lack of imagination

These proofs tell you where not to look for solutions.

### Claim $\{ 0^n 1^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ is not regular

#### Proof #1
Let B = $\{ 0^n 1^n | n \in \mathbb{N}\}$
Let M = {$Q, \sum, \delta, s, F$}

 It suffices to show that L(M) $\not=$ B.
 
 Let k = |Q|. Then there exists 0 $\leq i < j \leq$ k such that $\hat{\delta}(s, 0^i)$ = $\hat\delta(s, 0^j)$.  (Why?)
 
 It follows that $\hat\delta(s,0^i1^i)$ = $\hat\delta(s,0^j1^i)$ (Why?)
 
 $\hat\delta(s, 0^i1^i) \overset{hw}{=} \hat\delta(\hat\delta(s,0^i),1^i)$ 
 = $\hat\delta(\hat\delta(s, 0^j), 1^i)$
 $\overset{hw}{=} \hat\delta(s, 0^j, 1^j)$
 
 
It follows that M accepts both or neither of the strings $0^i 1^i$ and $0^j 1^i$. But exactly one of these two strings is an element of B so L(M) $\not=$ B $\blacksquare$

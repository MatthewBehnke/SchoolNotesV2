## Show that every regular language is represented by a regular expression 


Notation: 
 Let $\mathbb{N} = (Q, \sum, \Delta, S, F)$ be an NFA. For each $p, q in Q$ each $x \in \sum^*$ and each $\mathbb{R} \subseteq Q$ the expression $p \overset{x}{\rightarrow}\underset{R}{} q$

means that 

there is an x-path from p to q with all its intermediate states in R


### Main Lemma 

For each NFA $N = (Q, \sum, \Delta, S, F)$, each $p, q \in Q$, and each $R \subseteq Q$, there is a regular expression $\alpha_{pq}^R$ such that 

$L(\alpha_{pq}^R) = \{s \in \sum^*\ | p \overset{x}{\rightarrow}\underset{R}{} q \}$

### Theorem 

For every regular language $A \subseteq \sum^*$ there is a regular expression $\alpha$ such that $L(\alpha) = A$

### Proof  (using Lemma)

$\alpha = \sum\limits_{p \in S}^{}\sum\limits_{q \in F}^{} \alpha^Q_{p,q}$ $\blacksquare$


### Proof of Lemma (by induction on R)

Let $\alpha^\emptyset_{p,q} = \{$

- $\lambda + \downarrow$  : if p = q
- $\sum \{a \in Q | q \in \Delta(p,q)\}$  : if p $\not= q$

Assume the lemma holds for all $p, q \in Q$ for some fixed $R \not\subseteqq$, and let $r \in Q - R$. We want to show that the Lemma holds for $R \cup \{r\}$.

The picture 

Let $\alpha^{R \cup \{r\}}_{p,q}= \alpha^R_{pq} + \alpha^R_{p,r}(\alpha^R_{rr})^* \alpha^R_{rq}$ $\blacksquare$

## Computability

### Is Cosine computable?

yes! and we have to use Oracle Turing machines 


### Oracle Turing Machines 

$M^A$ or $M^g$ 

Idea is that the tm has its normal work tape but it also has (usually above) an oracle tape and a read only read only answer tape.

$f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is computable if there is an oracle TM M. Like this 

$\rightarrow^{r \in \mathbb{N}}_{\text{TM inpu}}\Box$ $\uparrow \downarrow (\text{oracle g for t})$ $\rightarrow M^g (r) \in Q$ such that $|M^g(r) - f(t)| \leq 2^{-r}$


## Thm  (< Moschovaskis '79)

A function f: $R \rightarrow R$ is continuous if and only if there is an oracle $A \subseteq N$ such that f is computable relative to the oracle A

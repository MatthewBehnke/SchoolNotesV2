Course Summary

Introduction to computer architecture and organization. Emphasis on evaluation of performance, instruction set architecture, datapath and control, memory-hierarchy design, and pipelining. Assembly language programming.

Course Objectives

* To understand aspects of computer architecture and program performance.

* To adopt an evolutionary approach to learning by presenting fundamental concepts first in the context of an easy-to-understand instruction set such as ARM, and building more complex ideas from the simpler ones.

Course Outcomes

This course has three major ABET outcomes:

* An ability to analyze a problem and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.  
* An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component or program to meet desired needs.  
* An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems that demonstrate comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.

Prerequisites

Course prerequisites are minimum of C- in COM S 228 and MATH 165; COM S 230 or CPR E 281; ENGL 250; or instructor permission. No exceptions. If you do not meet these prerequisites, it is the policy of the Computer Science department that you will automatically be unenrolled from this course..

Textbooks

Patterson and Hennessy is required. We will have assigned readings and problem sets from this text. Be sure that you have a ARM edition; the MIPS edition of the text has different problems and describes a different model architecture.

K&R is optional, recommended if you do not have at least a moderate level of experience programming in C. We will not have any required programming assignments in C, but we will—and Patterson and Hennessy does—use C examples to illustrate concepts in computer architecture.

* David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy, Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, ARM EDITION, ISBN 978-0-12-801733-3.

* Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, The C Programming Language, ISBN 0-13-110362-8.

Lecture Attendance

You are responsible for all material presented in lecture and are expected to attend; however, role will not be taken.

Canvas and Piazza

We will be using Canvas only for the gradebook, and homework submission. All other course materials, including announcements and discussion forums will be managed on Piazza.

Course Work

* Three exams totaling 50%.  
* A number (four planned) of written problem sets totaling 25%.  
* A number (two planned) of programming problems totaling 25%.

Exams will be administered via Canvas, open book, open notes.  Exam dates will be announced in lecture and on Piazza about a week in advance.  You will have a flexible window of a few days during which to complete each exam.  The first exam will be released shortly after completing the materials in chapters 1 and 2 of the textbook.  The second exam, after the materials in chapters 3 ad 4.  The final exam will cover materials in chapter 5.  The exams will be cumulative only in as much as they must be.

Lateness Policy

Late work will be accepted with no penalty until such time as the TAs begin grading, at which time submission will be closed and no further submissions will be accepted for the assignment. Thus the optimal submission strategy to maximize your grade is to complete and submit the required functionality by the deadline. If you fail to have a complete, correct submission by the deadline, the optimal remaining strategy is to continue to develop, and submit regularly, until such time as you complete the assignment or you find submission closed. The TAs will always take the last submission that was available at the time that they download the projects.

Grading

Midterm and final grades will be curved. The curves will not be determined until grades are calculated, and will be designed to fairly rank your performance against that of your peers and reward you appropriately for your work. A traditional 10-point scale establishes a lower bound on your grade now. Any curve that is applied at the midterm will establish a new lower bound for the final grade, which may in turn be curved even more in your favor.

Group Work

Programming assignments will be group work. Groups may have one or two students. Exactly one student in your group should submit the assignment. Submissions should contain a text file named members.txt listing the names and netids of group members. Additional details will be given in assignment specifications.

Academic Integrity

Exams and written problem sets are to be your own work. Programming solutions are to be the work of your group. We will take academic dishonesty seriously. We will report it to the Dean of Students. If you are found responsible for academic dishonesty in this class, you will receive a failing mark for the course. We believe that you are mature enough to understand “integrity” without a great deal of detail in the syllabus. Here we list some examples of things which you may and may not do in this class. If you are ever unsure, discuss it with the instructor.

The following examples should be taken in spirit, not as a complete list. For example, you may not edit another student's code, so it should be clear that you also may not write code on paper for another student to use. With respect to programming assignments, you may not:

* Share required elements of your project source code with anyone before the instructor clears those elements for sharing.  
* Study required elements of another students source code.  
* Submit another student's work as your own.  
* Debug another student's source code.  
* Edit another student's code.  
* Use third party code in your project without attribution.

You may:

* Discuss algorithms, data structures, and design with other students and on Canvas  
* Implement algorithms learned from third-party sources in your code  
* Share code that implements non-required functionality on Canvas.  
* Help another student debug, so long as that student “drives.”

Please speak with the instructor directly if you have any questions or doubts.

Free Expression

Iowa State University supports and upholds the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech and the principle of academic freedom in order to foster a learning environment where open inquiry and the vigorous debate of a diversity of ideas are encouraged. Students will not be penalized for the content or viewpoints of their speech as long as student expression in a class context is germane to the subject matter of the class and conveyed in an appropriate manner.

Accessibility Statement

  
Iowa State University is committed to assuring that all educational activities are free from discrimination and harassment based on disability status. Students requesting accommodations for a documented disability are required to work directly with staff in Student Accessibility Services (SAS) to establish eligibility and learn about related processes before accommodations will be identified. After eligibility is established, SAS staff will create and issue a Notification Letter for each course listing approved reasonable accommodations. This document will be made available to the student and instructor either electronically or in hard-copy every semester. Students and instructors are encouraged to review contents of the Notification Letters as early in the semester as possible to identify a specific, timely plan to deliver/receive the indicated accommodations. Reasonable accommodations are not retroactive in nature and are not intended to be an unfair advantage. Additional information or assistance is available online at www.sas.dso.iastate.edu, by contacting SAS staff by email at accessibility@iastate.edu, or by calling 515-294-7220. Student Accessibility Services is a unit in the Dean of Students Office located at 1076 Student Services Building.

Religious Accommodation

Iowa State University welcomes diversity of religious beliefs and practices, recognizing the contributions differing experiences and viewpoints can bring to the community. There may be times when an academic requirement conflicts with religious observances and practices. If that happens, students may request the reasonable accommodation for religious practices. In all cases, you must put your request in writing. The instructor will review the situation in an effort to provide a reasonable accommodation when possible to do so without fundamentally altering a course. For students, you should first discuss the conflict and your requested accommodation with your professor at the earliest possible time. You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the Dean of Students Office at 515-294-1020 or the Office of Equal Opportunity at 515-294-7612.

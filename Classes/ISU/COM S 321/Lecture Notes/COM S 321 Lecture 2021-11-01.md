## caches

16 KB 4 way associative cache, 32 byte lines

16KB = 2^14 bytes 
32 bytes = 2^5 bytes
2^14 / 2^5 = 2^9 lines 
2^9  / 2^2 - 2^7 sets 

tag = 52 bits
index = 7 bits
offset = 5 bits

tag + 1 bit valid = 53 bits x 2^9  bites of overhead 
tag + 1 bit valid = 53 bits x 2^6  bytes of overhead 


768 KB 3 way associative, 64 byte lines 

768 / 3 = 256 KB / set 
2^18 bytes / set
2^6 bytes / line 

2^12 lines per set 

tag = 46 bit
index = 12 bit
offset = 6 bit


(46 tag + 1 valid bit  ) x 3 x 2^12  = bits 

(46 tag + 1 valid bit  ) x 3 x 2^10  = bits 


## Motivating Associative caches 

8 line direct mapped cache 


n way associative cache - n lines per set

fully associative cache - all modern processors have (at least) one of these. Every line is in one set. (TLB or transnational look-aside buffer)

TLB is used for virtual memory

When we use minus in an associative cache, with i.e ti we replace 

eject 
- FIFO - eject in imont 
- LRU - least recently used
- NRU - not recently used 
- RR - round robin (same as FIFO)

FIFO is subject to Behidy's anomaly (look up Wikipedia)

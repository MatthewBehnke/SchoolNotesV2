When an exception occurs, execution continues according to a contract between the hardware and software(OS).

Hardware will:
- stop offending instruction 
- complete older instruction
- stop newer instructions
- set ELR 
- set ESR
- Branch to  a prearranged address.
	- on arm, that address is 0x1c090000
	- that code continues code to serve interrupts including an interrupt serves vector.

Os will service vector 
- check cause at the exception (ESR)
- act appropriately

## Precise vs Imprecise exceptions

- Precise
	- Know exactly where it occurred
- Imprecise
	- do not know exactly where it occurred
	 
Imprecise exceptions start to become an issue with out  of order processing and multiple issue not a predictable consume with the hardware were ...


## Instructions Level Parallelism (ILP)
Idea that parallelism exists between instructions. 

- Pipelines: 
	- Deeper pipelines (technically) allow for higher ILP
		- also have to have more bubbles because we have hazards 
	- Complexity from the
		-  Hardware 
		-  Compilers 
-  Multiple issues 
	-  issuing more than one instruction per cycle
	-  HW dynamically chooses which instruction to run from a window.
	-  Compiler puts instructions closer together to help hardware schedule instructions together into "packets"
	-  VILW (very long instruction works) 


## Static vs. Dynamic multiple issue

- Static ( Compile time )
	- Compiler schedules code into issues slots, each slot taking one instruction 
		- One ALU argument instruction and one loud or store
- Dynamic ( Run time)

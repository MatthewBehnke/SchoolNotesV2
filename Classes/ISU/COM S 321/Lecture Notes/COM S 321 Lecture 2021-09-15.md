# COM S 321 Lecture 2021-09-15

went over that we will have an asm assignment next Week

went over how to read and use our asm debug

## hw

develop sort in asm 


## LDXR \ STXR

load eXclusive Register
read eXclusive Register

```assembly
Given:
		LDXR Xn, [Xm, #0]
		// other code
		STXR Xp, Xq, [Xm]
```

If at any time between the extraction of LDXR and the subsquent STXR, the value [XM] changes STXR does not change [xm] and xa is set to 1, otherwise [xm] = xp + xa = 0.

To implement an atomic exchange
```assembly
again:
		LDXR x10, [x20, #]
		STXR x23, x9, [x20]
		CBNZ x23, again
		ADD x23, Xer, x10
	

```

atomic means uninterruptible


TO implement a lock

```assembly

		ADDI x11, xzr, #1

again:
		LDXR x10 [x20, #0]
		LBNZ x10, again
		STXR x11, x9, [x20]
		CBNZ x9, again
		

```


To reverse a lock

```assembly
STUR Xzr, [x20, #0]
```

## Encoding Instructions 
```assembly
ADD X19, X11, X12
```

X19 -> Rd  5 bits
X11 -> Rn 5 bits
X12 -> Rm 5 bits

ADD -> mnemonic 11 bits

# COM S 321 Lecture 2021-10-20

Finished up chapter 4 on [[2021-10-18]] and starting chapter 5 today.

## [[Locality]] & Memory Organization 

Memory organization in computers is build around the principle of locality.

### Principal of Locality

Programs access to a very small portion at their address space within small windows at time.

#### Temporal Locality 
Data used recently is likely to be used again soon

#### Spatial Locality
Data used recently is likely to be near data that will be needed soon

#### Example code demonstrating this idea
this is an example of a [[Low Pass Filter]]

```
for (i = 1; i < foo; i++) {
	b[i] = (a[i-1] + a[i] + a[i + 1])/3
}
```

[[Temporal]] Locality examples
- i
- elements of a
-  foo
-   a
-   b

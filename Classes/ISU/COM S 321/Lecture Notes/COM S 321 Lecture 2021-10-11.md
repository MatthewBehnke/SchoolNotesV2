## 2 bit prediction buffer

buffer [][] 

first [] is HOB
last [] is LOB

If 1 take Branch
if 0 do not take branch

if 11 or 10 then predict taken
if 01 or 00 then predict not taken

with one bit of prediction we only know how it behaved last time. But with two buts we know how it behaved the last four times.

## Predict branch targets
Use a branch target buffer. Implemented using a cache. Cache is indexed using the address of the branch instruction. 

cache

| tag (instruction address) | branch target address (offset) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
|                           |                                |
|                           |                                |
|                           |                                |
|                           |                                |
|                           |                                |
|                           |                                |

The number of r and c is some power of 2 that is index by lower order bits of address. 


## Hardware Exception 

Exception includes
- Reset
- I/O
- O/S Invocation 
- FP 
- Undefined Instructions


when an exception occurs we might have to 
- terminate the process 
- hardware recover? 
- software recover?

All of these are branches are we have to handle then in a similar way that we handle normal branches. 

H/W requires two special registers just for exception handling 

- ELR - Exception Link Register
	- Records the address of offending instruction
	- Used to continue execution after exception has been handled
- ESR - Exception Syndrome Register
	- Used to store the reason for the exception

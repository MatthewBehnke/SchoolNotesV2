### Ways to measure Earth's Climate

- ***Direct Measurements*** 
	- types 
		- instrumental
			- thermometers
			- $CO_2$ readings 
			- humidity 
			- pH 
		- Other
			- Ice cores
				- Extends timescales of direct records 
			- Historical 
	- Only good for time periods that have been measured
- ***Proxies***
	- types
		- Tree rings 
		- Fossils
		- Sediments 
			- Lake
			- Ocean
			- Continental coastline
		- cores 
		- outcrops
		- Coral reeds
	- Something that is not a direct measurement, but is in some way controlled by it  
	- Delta Notation 
		- Used to report stable isotope data: ratio between heavy and light isotopes, compared to a standard

### Using records of $\delta^{18}O$
- Measure these in little fossils
- Benthic ***foraminifera***
- Bentic  == bottom water
- The bottom of the water is basically the same temp everywhere 
- Produces a globally coherent signal

### Climate system
- What is ***climate*** 
- Weather integrated over long time periods 
- What controls earths climate 
	- ***Isolation***
	- ***Change in orbit***
	- ***Greenhouse gases***
	- ***Silicate carbonate feedback***
		- Weathering
### Earth's climate system

- Energy from the sun comes in 
- Some reflects back, either from clouds or the surface 
- Some absorbed by land, clouds, atmosphere
- Some outgoing radiation trapped and re-emitted by greenhouse gasses 

### Insolation

- Effects of 
	- Latitude 
	- Tilt 
- Greater the angle of incoming sunlight the lower the sunlight intensity 


### Milankovitch Cycles 

- Periodic changes in Earth's orbit affect insolation
- Types of changes 
	- Eccentricity
		- Earth encounters more variation in the energy it receives from the sun when Earths orbit is elongated than it does when earth's orbit is more circular 
	- Tilt 
		- The tilt of earths axis varies between 22.2 and 24.5 degrees. The grater the tilt angle is, the more solar energy the poles revive 
	- Precession
		- A gradual change or wobble in the orientation of earths axis affects the relationship between Earths tilt and eccentricity 
- Reflected in lots of geologic records 

### Deep time insolation changes 
- ***Faint young sun***

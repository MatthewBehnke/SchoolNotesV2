### COURSE OVERVIEW

Mountains, volcanoes, earthquakes, and constantly-moving tectonic plates are all part of the dynamic Earth on
which we live. As geologists, it is our job to ask and answer important questions about Earth and its geologic
processes that impact our physical environment and its resources. In this class, students will learn how Earth
works, what it is made of, and how geologists study Earth using the scientific process.

**COURSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES**
After completing this course, students will:
▪ Have a thorough understanding of plate tectonics as the overarching theory explaining how the Earth works;
▪ Understand that Earth is a complex system of interacting rock, water, air, and life; and
▪ Know that the Earth is 4.6 billion years old and is constantly changing.

Specific learning objectives for this course include being able to explain:
▪ the differences between divergent, convergent, and transform plate boundaries
▪ the relationships between plate tectonic settings, volcano types, eruptive styles, and lava compositions
▪ the geochronological methods used to determine the age of the Earth, rocks, and geologic events
▪ the physical processes responsible for geological hazards and landforms.

### STUDENT LEARNING

The semi-asynchronous online delivery of this course means you may work at your own pace within a given week.
Course content, including recorded lectures, videos, additional reading, etc., will be posted within weekly modules
on Canvas. So, in order to adequately prepare for exams, you will need to explore one module and complete
module quizzes and assignments each week. Study guides will be provided to the class before each exam.
**_Estimated workload for this class is 8-12 hours per week_**. Above all, you are expected to self-motivate and
actively manage your learning. As instructor, I am always available for questions and to support your efforts.

**CANVAS**
Course content, quizzes, assignments, gradebook, announcements, etc. will be available through the Canvas
learning management system. All students registered in the course will automatically be enrolled into course
Canvas page.

**REQUIRED TEXTBOOK**
_Earth: An Introduction to Physical Geology_ by Tarbuck, Lutgens, and Tasa
Students will be able to access the required textbook via Canvas as part of the Iowa State University Immediate
Access Program. More information on the Immediate Access Program can be found below.


### COMMUNICATION WITH THE INSTRUCTOR

Email, discussion posts/replies, and Webex meetings will be the typical means of communication with me. Feel
free to send me any questions, concerns, comments, or interesting articles, videos, comics, etc. that involve
geology or science in general. When emailing me, make sure the subject line of your email includes “GEOL 100 ” to
ensure I notice, read, and respond to your message. Any messages that do not include “GEOL 100 ” in the subject
may be lost forever in the maelstrom that is my inbox.

**GRADES**
Your final grade will be based on 375 points, consisting of exams, lecture quizzes, and homework assignments. It is
your responsibility to keep track of points in the Canvas gradebook and call any errors to my attention within two
weeks of the posting of the relevant grade.

**Any grade appeals made more than two weeks after the posting of the relevant grade will not be considered.**

```
Exams (175 points total)
Exams in this class include three midterm exams (50 points each) and a comprehensive final exam (75 points)
offered during the dates and times listed on the course schedule. Each exam will consist of multiple choice and
short answer questions. Your lowest regular exam score (not the final!) will be dropped at the end of the
course. Midterm exams will have a 75 - minute timer whereas the final exam will have a 90-minute timer.
```
```
Students in the Ames area are required to take exams at one of the testing center locations on the Iowa State
University campus. More information on the ISU testing center can be found on their website:
http://www.testcenter.iastate.edu/.
```
```
No make-up exams will be offered unless the instructor is notified in advance (i.e., more than 24 hours
before the exam deadline).
```
```
Lecture/reading quizzes (1 20 points total)
Each module of online content (i.e., lecture videos, readings, etc.) will be followed by a quiz worth 3 points to
help students keep up with class content. In a typical week, three quizzes will be offered and consist of 3- 5
questions that range in format from multiple choice to short answer questions. Each quiz will be available from
12:01 am Monday to 11:59 pm on the following Monday during the relevant week, giving students more than a
week to complete the quizzes on their own schedule. Your two lowest quiz grades will be dropped at the end
of the semester. No late quizzes will be accepted.
```
```
Homework assignments ( 80 points)
Homework will be assigned during 4 weeks of the semester. Each homework will be worth 15 - 25 points and
require students to demonstrate their knowledge of course content in a more thorough way than allowed by
the online quizzes. The format of the homework assignments will vary from week to week and may involve
online research, math-based exercises, or short essays. No late homework assignments will be accepted.
```
```
Extra credit opportunities
Extra credit up to a maximum of 10 points may be earned towards the final course grade. You are strongly
encouraged to pursue extra credit, because an additional 10 points is equal to a ~2.67% boost to your final
grade. Extra credit opportunities will be announced on Canvas.
```
### GRADING SCALE

Lower boundaries for letter grades are as follows:
A 92% B+ 86% C+ 76% D+ 66% F < 59%
A- 89% B 82% C 72% D 62%

### IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY IMMEDIATE ACCESS PROGRAM

This course is enrolled in the Iowa State University Immediate Access Program. Immediate Access is a collaborative
affordability initiative between the ISU Book Store, faculty, and publishers. Students that are enrolled in an
Immediate Access course will receive access to all required digital course materials the first day of class and at a
reduced cost compared to the national average. Students will be automatically charged on their u-bills for this
digital content. The billing description on your u-bill will show the department and course number, followed by
“IMMED ACCESS” and the last 4 digits of the billing ISBN. There is a tool on the navigation menu of your Canvas
course called Immediate Access Course Materials. You will receive an email shortly before classes start that will
instruct you on how to access the required digital course materials. You may not be able to access the digital
content until the first day of class. For further questions about Immediate Access please
email immediateaccess@iastate.edu.

Students who drop the course within the first 10 days of class will receive a refund on their u-bill (5 days for
courses 8 weeks or shorter). You do not have to notify the bookstore if you drop the course. This is an automated
process.

Students may choose to opt out of the program. Opting out does not mean you are dropping the course. It simply
means you are choosing not to receive the digital content from the bookstore and you must find another way to
acquire it in order to complete required homework assignments. Students have within the first 10 days of class to
opt out and receive a refund to their u-bill (5 days for courses 8 weeks or shorter). Instructions on how to opt out
will be emailed shortly before classes start.

**ACADEMIC DISHONESTY**
The class will follow Iowa State University’s policy on academic dishonesty. Anyone suspected of academic
dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office. Details can be found here:

creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the assessment or learning activity. You are also
welcome to contact the Student Accessibility Services (515- 294 - 7220) to begin this conversation or to establish

preference early in the semester.

### RELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION

Iowa State University welcomes diversity of religious beliefs and practices, recognizing the contributions differing
experiences and viewpoints can bring to the community. There may be times when an academic requirement
conflicts with religious observances and practices. If that happens, students may request reasonable
accommodation for religious practices. In all cases, you must put your request in writing. The instructor will review
the situation in an effort to provide a reasonable accommodation when possible to do so without fundamentally
altering a course. For students, you should first discuss the conflict and your requested accommodation with your
professor at the earliest possible time. You or your instructor may also seek assistance from the Dean of Students
Office at 515- 294 - 1020 or the Office of Equal Opportunity at 515- 294 - 7612.

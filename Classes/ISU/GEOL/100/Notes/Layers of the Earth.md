# Layers of the Earth

Chemical Layers: 
Each layer has a different chemical makeup

* Crust
	* Oceanic: (7-10km thick)
	* Continental: (25-70km thick)
* Mantle: 2885km think
* Core: 3480 km think


Physical Layers (based on phase/strength)

* [[Lithosphere]] ~100 km thick (crust + upper mantle)
* [[Asthenosphere]] ~ 300 km think (upper mantle)
* Outer core: Liquid iron nickel
* Inner core: Solid iron-nickel

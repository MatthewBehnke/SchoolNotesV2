# Lithosphere

Strength (the ability to withstand pressure/stress without braking) of a rock depends on:
	- Composition
	- temperature
	- pressure
	
Temp and pressure increase with depth in Earth's interior 

Rocks at the top of [[Asthenosphere]] are weak and easily deformed due to the temperatures and pressures experiences at that depth

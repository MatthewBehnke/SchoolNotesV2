## What is an earthquake intensity scale 

The Mercalli Intensity Scale is a Qualitatively scale with the intensity depending on the distance from the epicenter and other factors like type of soil or bedrock at the location  

## What factors affect the intensity of an earthquake as experienced by a person on the surface

The distance, type of bedrock etc. ...

## What is an earthquake magnitude scale

The amount of ground motion and energy released. Magnitude scales allow the size to be defined in a uniform way.

## What is the difference between a magnitude 4 earthquakes and a magnitude 8 earthquake in terms of grown motion and released energy 

10,000 times more grown motion 
8 million times more energy

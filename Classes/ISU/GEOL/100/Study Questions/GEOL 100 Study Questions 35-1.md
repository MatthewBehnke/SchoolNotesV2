# GEOL 100 Study Questions 35-1

## What is a ''cone of depression" in the context of groundwater

When the water table drops to a deep well when the rate of discharge exceeds the rate of recharge 

## What happens when pumping exceeds the recharge rate of an aquifer 
the pump will run dry 


## How can pumping change the direction of natural flow of groundwater 

if the ground water drops to low the water will flow reversed 

## How can subsidence be caused by unsustainable pumping of groundwater 

if we drain a lot of the ground water the water that was in the ground pushing the land up drops

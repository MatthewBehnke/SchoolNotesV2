# GEOL 100 Study Questions 34-1

## What is porosity 

is the amount of open space within a material and expressed by a percentage of the total volume of the material 

## What is the relationship between porosity and amount of water be stored in rocks 

higher the porosity more water can be stored

## What does a porosity value mean? 

10% means 10% is open space that can store water

## How does the packing and grain size of a sedimentary rock affect its porosity 

larger the grain size and less packing means greater porosity 

## What is permeability 

is the ability of a material to allow fluids to pass through the interconnected network of pore spaces 

## Do rocks with high porosity always have high permeability 

no each are independent 

## What is one reason that ground water flows more slowly than surface runoff 

ground water has a tortuous path because it has to go through stuff

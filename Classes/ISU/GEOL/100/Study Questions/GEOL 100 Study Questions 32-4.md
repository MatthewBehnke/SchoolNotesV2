## How does the difference between peak discharge and avenge discharge influence whether a stream will have a meandering shape or braided shape 

If there is major differences in peak discharge and average discharge 

## What is bedload

## How do braided streams and meandering streams differ in terms of sediment load 

braided streams ahave lots of coarse sediment where meandering have a mix of suspended and bed load

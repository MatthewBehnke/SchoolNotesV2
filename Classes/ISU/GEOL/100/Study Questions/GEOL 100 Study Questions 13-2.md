## What is exfoliation and jointing

Exfoliation is when rocks are brought to the surface from pressure and is allowed to expand. 

Jointing is the process of when rocks come to the surface hot and then cool down and pull together. 

## What causes rocks to expand and break during exfoliation and jointing

[[physical weathering]] causes the rocks to expand and break because of the sudden lack of pressure. 

##  What causes columnar jointing in igneous rocks

The rapid cooling from the outside causes shrinkage and cracks.

## What is [[frost-wedging]]

frost wedging is caused when water gets into cracks in rocks and then freezes and the water expands to 109% of its water volume when frozen resulting in cracks. 

## How do moving fluids cause abrasion 

Water and other fluids move from pose spaces to areas that ice crystals can form. The Ice grown in space causing abrasion. 


## What is the largest contributor to physical weathering in recent history

The ice age?

# GEOL 100 Study Questions 28-2

## What are the five layers that make up oceanic lithosphere

- deep see sediment 
- basaltic pillow lavas
- sheeted dike complex
- gabbro / layerd gabbro
- mantle (peridotite)


## what is the origin of each of the five layers on oceanic lithosphere

- deep see sediment : settled out of water
- basaltic pillow lavas: from the lava that cools down
- sheeted dike complex : the splitting of the cooled lava
- gabbro / layerd gabbro : from the mantle
- mantle (peridotite) from the mantle

## How are the five layers related to seafloor spreading at a divergent plate boundary 

the sea floor gets pulled apart 

## What happens to ocean water when it percolates into oceanic crust near a divergent plate boundary

the water that gets heated up and goes supercritical.

## What is a supercritical fluid

water that has cations in it that acts like a gas.  

## What is an ophiolite 

the piece of oceanic lithosphere that was thrown up and onto continental lithosphere

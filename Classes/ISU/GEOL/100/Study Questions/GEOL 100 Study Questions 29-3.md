# GEOL 100 Study Questions 29-3

## How does water move when a wind-driven wave travels through it 

The water moves in a circular orbital motion 

## What is wave base

the level at wave energy is zero or half the wavelength of surface wave form

## Why do waves lean towards the shore when waves enter shallow water

Because the circular orbital motion pulls them to the shore 

## What causes waves to bend, or refract, when they reach the coast

the orbital motion hits the sea floor. The wave wants to be paralle with the shore so it slows down / speeds up to match 


## How does that bending cause coastal erosion along some parts of the coast and deposition of sediment on other parts

the part that is hit first has the most energy where the part that is hit last get sediment deposited 

## What is longshore drift and how does it occur

swash from incoming wave front (5 degrees to shore line ) will move sediment up shore at the same angle. 

backwash will follow the topographic gradient of the beach

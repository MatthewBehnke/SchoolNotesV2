# GEOL 100 Study Questions 14-1

## What is the difference between clastic sedimentary rock and a chemical sedimentary rock

clastic forms by weathering, erosion, and transportation, deposition and lithification

chemical forms through chemical processes

## What are the 4 steps of forming a clastic sedimentary rock 
weathering, erosion, and transportation, deposition and lithification

## What is a transportation medium in the context of sediment transport 

water 

## How does lithification of sediment occur 

compaction using pressure from overlying sediment compresses the sediment
cementation uses minerals like calcite and silica to fill in the pore spaces cementing minerals together

# GEOL 100 Study Questions 25-1

## What is the difference between an epicenter and hypocenter

A epicenter is a position on the surface of the earth directly above the hypocenter which is the position in the fault where the rupture and slip occurs

## What is elastic energy in the context of geologic deformation

Elastic energy in the context of geologic deformation is that rocks bend elastically storing energy in the rock. 

## In our clamp and block model, what happens to the stored elastic energy when the rock finally breaks

When the rocks break the blocks will slip past each other, releasing elastic energy causing an earthquake. The rocks will go back into their original shape.

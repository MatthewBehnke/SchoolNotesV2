# GEOL 100 Study Questions 32-1

## What is a longitudinal profile of a stream 

cross section view of topography parallel to the stream channel along its length 

## What are the three zones of our water shed model 

zone of sediment production 

zone of transportation 

zone of deposition 

## How do these zones differ from each other in therms of erosion and deposition of sediment 

zone of sediment production 

mainly erosion 

zone of transportation 

neither 

zone of deposition 

mainly deposition of sediment 


## Hoe does the zone of sediment production and the zone of transportation differ in terms of 

- Gradient 

production is very steep where the deposition is flat

- channel roughness

very rough in the zone of production but not rough in the zine of transportation  

- Sinuosity 

production  has low Sinuosity where the zone of transportation is high  Sinuosity

- Discharge

lots of discharge at the transportation zone and little in the  zone of production

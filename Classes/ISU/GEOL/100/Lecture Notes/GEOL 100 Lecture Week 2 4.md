# What is a mineral

## What makes a mineral?

A substance must meet 5 criteria in order to be consider a mineral 

- Naturally occurring
- Inorganic
	No chains of hydrocarbons
- Solid 
- Crystalline
- Definable chemical composition

# Ways for a mineral to form

- Solidification (freezing) from  melt 
- Precipitation 
- Biomineralization
- Precipitation from a gas
- Solid state diffusion

# Physical properties of a mineral

- Color = color of a hand specimen of a mineral 
	- Typically unreliable, but a good place to start
	- One mineral can occur in multiple colors due to chemical impurities 
- Streak = color of a powdered mineral 
- Luster = the appearance of light reflected off of the mineral 
- Hardness = resistance to abrasion 
	- Easy to be relied on
- Specific gravity = dimensionless measure of density calculated by ratio of density of mineral to that of water 
- Crystal Habit = shape of a mineral crystal or aggregate of minerals
- Cleavage = tendency to break along particular geometric planes
- Fracture = tendency to break equally in all directions

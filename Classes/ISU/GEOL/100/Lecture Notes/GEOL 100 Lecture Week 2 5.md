# What Controls mineral properties 

Cleavage = tendency to break along particular geometric planes 

## Chemistry refresher

The octet Rule: Atoms will gain or lose electrons in order to have 8 elections in their outermost shell

- Cations = atoms or groups of atoms with fewer elections then protons, positive charge 
	- Relatively large atomic radii 
- Anions = atoms or groups of atoms with more electrons then protons, negative charge
	- relatively small atomic radii

Bond Strength increases when:
- Ionic: Difference in changes increase and distance between charges decreases
	- Opposites attract
- Covalent: Number of shared elections increase 	


##  Ion Sizes and Crystal Structures

The size of the ions affect how closely packed they can be in compounds, which affects the crystal structure and its strength.


## Polymorphs 

Polymorphs = 2 or more minerals with same chemical compositions but different crystal structures

## Silicon-Oxygen Tetrahedron

Tetrahedron = three dimentional shape with four triangular surfaces

## Independent or Isolated Silicates 

- No sharing of oxygen among silicon-oxygen tetrahedral
- Tetrahedron are binded to cations like $Fe^{2+} Mg^{2+}$, etc
 
 
 ## Olivine Group Minerals
 
 Chemical Formula $(X)_2 SiO_4$
 
 Most common olivine minerals
 Fayalite 
 Forsterite
 
 Hardness 6.5 - 7
 Specific Gravity 3.2 - 4.3 
 
 ## Chain Silicates
 
Single Chains
- 2 of the 4 oxygens are shared 
- silicon to oxygen ration = 1:3

## Pyrozene Group vs Amphibole Group Minerals 

Hardness: 5-6
Specific gravity: 4-3.5


## Sheet Silicates 

These exist


## Framework Silicates

Silicon to Oxygen ration = 1:2

No plains of weakness

hardness: 6-7


## Feldspar group Minerals

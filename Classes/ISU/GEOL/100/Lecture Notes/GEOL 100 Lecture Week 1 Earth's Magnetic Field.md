# GEOL 100 Lecture Week 1 Earth's Magnetic Field

## New evidence and new mechanisms

Post-World war II technology allowed researchers to:
- Map the shape of the ocean floor ([[Bathymety]])
- Measure the magnetic signal of the crust ([[Paleomagnetism]])
- Measure the thickness of the ocean sediment
- Discover the non random distribution of earthquakes

The [[Lithosphere]] is subdivided into "plates" with three general types of boundaries

- Divergent boundaries
	<- ->
- Convergent boundaries
 -><-
- Transform fault boundaries
   Past one another
   
 ## Magnets 
 
 The magnetic field produces lines of force, such that:
 - Charged particles will experience a force pushing them from south pole to the north pole.
 - Magnetic materials will align themselves with the lines of force

The Earths magnetic field is just like a dipolar magnetic. it has a north and south magnetic pole.

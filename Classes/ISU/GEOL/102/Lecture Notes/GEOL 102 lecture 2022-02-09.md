# [[GEOL 102]] Lecture [[2022-02-09]]

- Friday is the last day of this module 


Why study ancient climate and temperature?
What tools can we use?

### Types of archives 

- Isotope proxies 
	- Oxygen isotopes
	- Hydrogen isotopes
	- Depends on temperature
	- Clumped isotopes: measure the number of bonds between HEAVY isotopes like $^{13}C$ and $^{18}$O
- Physical proxies 
- Global Climate Models



### Paleosols 

- The kinds of minerals in the soils depends on the composition of the atmosphere
- Can use to estimate $CO_2$ levels 
- Found as old as 3.5 billion years


### Non-geochemical proxies 

Rocks and mineral deposits

- Use rocks formed by glaciers to tell when the earth was cold 


### Global Climate Models 

Use a kind called a General Circulation Model 

- Break Earth up into grid cells 
- Attempt to represent physical processes 
- Amazing at high-resolution, short time scale runs 
- Can't simulate long time scales


### Earth's long term climate history 

- Long term cooling

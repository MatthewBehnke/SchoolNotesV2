### Paleoproterozoic 

- Transition form the Archean

Great oxidation event 

#### Evidence for Archean ocean compositon 


### Banded Iron Formation 

- Alternating, thin layers of iron oxide and shale / chert
- Iron material either magnetite or hematite 
- Iron is oxidized 
- Silica layer is repeated 

#### How did they form 

- Must have some way to oxidize

 
###  Cyanobacteria Evolution 
Single celled photosynthetic bacteria That produced $O_2$


### Cyano Evolution 

- When did they evolve (Options)
	- Very old 3.5 Ga Stromatolites 
	- Kinda old 2.7 Ga: Geo-chemical proxies 
	- Not too old 2.4 Ga: Great Oxidation Event - sulfur MIF

### Geo-chemical proxies: Uranium concentrations 

- Uranium has different solubility depending on if O_2 is present 
- Uranium is insoluble in anoxic conditions 
- Uranium is soluble in oxic conditions 
- Source of U is the continental crust 

### Mesoproterozoic 

Period of apparent long-term climate stability 

### Carbon isotopes 

Stable
- c_12
- c_13

Unstable 
- c_14

## Complexity Classes (Hardness of Problem)

$P \subseteq NP$

### P-class 

A set of problems that can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time

### NP-class

A set of problems that can be verified in polynomial time 

## Decision Problems 

where assumes true / false

P = the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time 

NP = the set of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a non deterministic algorithm


## Reduction 

Decision problem A can be viewed as a function 

A $I_A \rightarrow \{time false\}$

B $I_B \rightarrow \{time false\}$ 

$\forall i \in I_A A(i) = B(f(i))$

where f polytime algo that translates elements of $I_A$ to elements of $I_B$ then $A \leq_P B$



np-complete = NP $\cap$  NP-hard

is A NP Complete 

(A) A is a poly time function 
(B) all Np problems can be reduced to A

(B') pick an NP- complete problem B $B \leq_P A$

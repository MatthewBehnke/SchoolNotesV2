## Kosaragu's SCC Algorithm

a [[Graph Theory]] algo

### Observation 1
If $C_1$ has an edge to $C_j$ then there exists a vertex in $C_1$ whose end time is greater than the end time of any vertex in $C_j$.

### Observation 2
If the edges of a graph is reversed, then the structure of SCC in the graph remains unchanged.

### Observation 3
A vertex with the highest end time in DFS exploration of G belongs to the BSCC(bottom strongly connected complement) of the $G^T$(edges of G is reversed).

```c
DFS Exploration: G(V,E)
	int for all c in V 
		v.visited = false
		
	for all v in V
		if v.visited == false
			DFS(v)
			
DFS(v)
	v.visited = true
	for all u in N(v)
		if u.visited == false
			DFS(u)
	add u to stack
	
G^T = reverse (G)
			

	int  for all v in V 
		v.visited = false
	
	int i = 0
		
	while stack is not empty 
		v = pop from stack
		if v.visited == false
				DFS2(v,i)
				i++

			
DFS2(v,i)
	v.visited = true
	add v to SCC[i]
	for all u in N(v)
		if v.visited == false
			DFS2(u)
```

## If asked to implement Kosaragu's SCC Algorithm

Data structure to use: 
- adjacent list (an array of lists)
	- O(V + E)
- adjacent matrix (double array where a 1 represents an edge) 
	- O($V^2$)

## Regular Greed

able to compute the vertex edges on the fly so there is no need to store the edges.

## [[Algorithm Strategies]]

- [[Divide and Conquer]]
	- Steps
		- Divide the given problem into sub problems
			- (x) sub problem and the problem are of the same type
			- Sub problems must be independent of each other.
		- Solve the sub problems (recursively solve sub problems)
		- Combine sub problem solutions to obtain the solution for the problems
	- Types of algorithms 
		- Merge sort

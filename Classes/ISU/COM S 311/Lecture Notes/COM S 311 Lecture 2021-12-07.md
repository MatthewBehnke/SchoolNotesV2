## P/NP

- P: poly time solvable 
- NP: poly time verifiable 
- NP-hard: All problems in NP can be reduced to NP-hard class of problems
- NP-complete: NP $\cap$ NP-hard


## How to prove a problem is in NP

A = Given a weighted undirected G = (V, E), does there  exist a spanning tree $\not w$ cost $\leq$ 121

B = Given a set of interds, does there exist a subset of size $\geq$ 11 of non overlapping intervals 

### Prove that A is in NP

Let T be a certificate which shows G has a spanning tree of cost $\leq$ 121

Verify (G, T)

- Check that T contains all vertices in G 
- Some of cost of edges in T $\leq$ 121
- T is a connected Tree (BFS / DFS)

Show that the steps can be done in poly time 

### Prove that B is in NP

Cert: subset of intervals 
Verification (I, S)
 
 - |S |$\geq$ 11
 - S : contains non overlapping intervals from I

### Given a problem A prove that A is in NP-complete 

- Part 1: Prove A is in NP
- Part 2:
	-  Select some np-complete problem B that is in NP-complete 
	- prove that $B \leq_P A$

### Independent set of a graph 

Given a graph G = (V, E) does there exist a set of vertices $\leq$ such that $|S| = k$ and no two vertices in $\leq$ is connected by an edge

- prove IS(G,K) is in NP-complete 

part 1 is (G,K) in NP

- cert is a set of vertices S 

verification
- |s| = k
- $\forall u \forall v u,v \in s \Rightarrow (u,v) \not\in E$

Part 2

Assume (3 set is NP-complete)


## Vertex Cover 

Given a G = (V, E) does there exist a set S of vertices such that |S| = K and for all edges (u,v) $\in E$ $u \in S$ or $u \in S$

$V C (G, K)$ is NP-complete


## Reduce IS(G,k)

T is an independent set for graph G $|T| = k$
$T = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, ... v_k\}$
S = $V - T$ = $\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ... v_{n -k}\}$

## Counting Rank Inversion

At max there will be n - 1 , n- 2, n- 3

| 15  | 14  | 13  | 12  | 10  | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Because the array goes from largest to smallest there will be the max amount of inversions 

### Brute force way to solve the problem 

Just use two loops 
takes O(n^2)

### [[Divide and Conquer]]

Takes O(n long n)

1. Divide the array into two equal arrays A1, A2
2. c1 = count the number of inversions in A1
	c2 =.... in A2
3. c3 = count the number of split inversions 
4. return c1 + c2 + c3


## [[Integer Multiplication]]

Could just do n*n because there are n levels and n multiplications steps to take 

We can do better with divide and conquer

## Closest pair of points in 2D plane

Brute force runtime would be O(n^2) pick a point and search every other point then do that for every other point.

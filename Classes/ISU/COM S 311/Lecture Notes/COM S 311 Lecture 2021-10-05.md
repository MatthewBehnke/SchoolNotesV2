# COM S 311 Lecture 2021-10-05

## Exam 1

went over exam one and common places that students had problems on.

problem 3

## [[Divide and Conquer]] Cont


### Ex4

T(n)  = 4T(n/2) + cn
$\in$ O(n^2)

### Ex 5

T(n) = at(n/2) + cn $\in$ O($n^{log n}$)

### Ex 6

T(n) - T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + cn

### Places that Divide and Conquer are applied 

#### [[Rank Inversion Count]]

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6   | 3   | 7   | 4   | 15  | 2   | 18  |

Index I < index j and A[i] > A[J] then there is an inversion

Inversion between

| left | right |
| ---- | ----- |
| 6    | 3     |
| 6    | 4     |
| 6    | 2     |
| 3    | 2     |
| 4    | 2     |
| 7    | 4     |
| 7    | 2     |


Example

| ranking | m_1 | m _2 | m _3 | m_n |
| ------- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| you     | 1   | 2    | 3    | k   |
| me      | 2   | 1    | 18   | 3   |

The number of inversions caculates the degree of diffrence

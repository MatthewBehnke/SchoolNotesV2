# Write through caching

Writes through all levels of [[cache]] right away. The write is immediately written to every level of cache. This requires a lot of memory bandwidth  

This can be sped up using a [[Writebuffer]]

## Uses

- In [[Multiprocessing]] every core will have the same data with no overhead but writes take awhile.

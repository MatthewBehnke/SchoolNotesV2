# The Power Wall

The main reason why CPU's switched to multi processors


## Main idea
It became impossible to continue increase power on a processor and keep it cooled.

Power $\sim$ $Voltage^2 \times Frequency$ (scale approx linearly)

Power $\sim$ $Voltage^3$ (decent rule)

## Result

We moved from single cores to multi cores to take the focus off of the clock rate and onto other factors like the number of cores.



## stuff

Energy - Proportional to capacitative $load \times\ voltage^2$.	
Energy is $Power \times\ Time$

# Translation Lutasive Buffer

A TLB is a fully associative [[cache]] of precise table entries 

Fully [[associative]] memory is very expensive mainly because of the compactor per entry and the busses, but also the MUX and DEMUX bandwidth. 

With a cached page table entry we don't need to wait on the page table access TLB access takes L1 to a few cycles depending on size missing in the TLB takes 10^s 

TLb miss rates are very low

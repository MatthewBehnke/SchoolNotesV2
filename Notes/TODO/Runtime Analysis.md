# Runtime Analysis

- The number of [[Atomic Steps]] a program will do to solve a problem
- Random Access Machine (RAM)
- Defined as a function of the number of inputs

	 Example: 
	```c
	Search Algo
	n : Side array
	1 : Key
	
	n + 1 inputs
	
	f(n) = number of steps
	
	```


[[Big-O Notation]] is used to describe the complexity 


## Dominance of a function 

```

f is dominated by g iff
exists c > 0, exists n0 >= 1 
if `f` is dominated by g we can say f in O(g)

```

##  Algorithms time

Constant time:
O(1)

Logarithmic time:
O(logn)

Linear time:
O(n)

no name:
O(nlogn)

Quadratic time:
O(n^2)
O(n^3)
O(n^...)

Exponential 
O(2^n)
O(...^n)

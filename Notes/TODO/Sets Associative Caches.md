## Sets associative caches

Caches which allows sets of lines with identical indexes to exist side by side in the cache, prevents premoaite ejection of data. Like direct mapped cache address is broken down into tag, index, and offset.

### Examples

#### Cache is 8 KB, 4-way associated, 32 bytes lines

8KB  = $2^13$ Bytes
32 Bytes = $2^5$ Bytes

The number of lines  = $2^{13} / 2^5 = 2^8$

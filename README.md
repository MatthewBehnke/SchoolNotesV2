# My notes 

This project contains my notes for my studies. My studies include my time at [[Classes/ISU/Iowa State University]] studying [[Organisations/Iowa State University/Computer Science/Computer Science]] starting at about my third year and my time following the [[Open Source Society University]] studying [[Organisations/Open Source Society University/Computer Science/Computer Science]], math, and data science


This project will also include other study's that are not part of Iowa state or ossu. For example they might be work funded or just some YouTube video that I decided to take notes on because I realized it actually related my to computer science in some.eay or another.

I'm thinking about creating an other category that I put things under to keep them separate
